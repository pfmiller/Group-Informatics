  "body": "### Welcome to the LASI Social Network Analysis Workshop!\r\n\r\nPrior to the workshop, I ask you to read (or at least scan) four papers of mine which will give you a conceptual overview of how I, as a researcher, apply social network analysis in learning (and other) contexts.  They are listed below:\r\n\r\n  - [Performance and Social Structure in Learning Groups:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/GogginsGalyenLaffey-2016.pdf) \r\n  - [Group Informatics:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/Goggins-2013.pdf)\r\n  - [Group Informatics for user modeling and personalization:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/USER735.pdf) \r\n  - [Network Analysis of Trace Data to Support Group Work:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/p107-goggins.pdf)\r\n\r\nYou should load, if you can, “R” (r-project.org) and Gephi on your computers https://gephi.org . Also, loading the github client may be helpful for you.  But not necessary. \r\n\r\n### A Good Overview of the History of Social Network Analysis \r\n\r\nI think you may find it surprising how such a prominent technique for understanding structure evolved in different ways over time, and has lately taken what I think of as a signifiant mathematical turn. Running analysis to identify structure in online learning requirements could be as \"easy\" as treating each user act as an edge, and each user as a node. In the first readings I reference in advance of our workshop, you see that I am making an argument for a systematic, empirically and theoretically informed set of decisions about how nodes are defined and how the strength of connection between those nodes (edges or \"lines\") is presented. \r\n\r\n[Linton Freeman's History of Social Network Analysis](http://www.sociallycompute.io/Freeman%202004.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Outline of our Journey Through Social Network Analysis as a Learning Analytics Method\r\n\r\nSocial Network Analysis is widely used, and sometimes not used well to understand technology mediated learning and a host of other phenomena that emerge online. [Howison, Wiggins and Crowston](http://www.sociallycompute.io/HWC.pdf) point out a number of significant flaws in prior applications of SNA methods, developed for the study of human's and the social structures they create in the physical world, to \"electronic trace data\" (log files) generated through online behavior. The Freeman history, the Howison, Wiggins and Crowston critique and the four papers I provided help frame the challenges of using SNA well as a method for making sense of learning and developing learning analytics. \r\n\r\n+ Day One\r\n\r\n++ Session One: Social Network Analysis in Learning Contexts. Examples in R and Python. Concepts: SNA, Limitations of SNA, Reshaping and Weighting trace data.\r\n\r\n++ Session Two: Exploring Hidden Epistemological Choices in the use of SNA to Make Sense of Learning Environments. Examples in R and Python. Concepts: The Ontological Choices we Make when we create sociograms, and how those choices can hide our epistemological choices. \r\n\r\n++ Tools for SNA in R, Python and Gephi. Discuss strengths and limits of specific libraries and tools. \r\n\r\n++ Key Notes: Datasets will be introduced, and we may divide into more than one subgroup based on interests and experience. \r\n\r\n+ Day Two\r\n\r\n++ Session One: Research Questions: What kinds of questions can we answer with SNA; and what kinds are difficult to answer with sea Alone (hint: Many). Concepts: Frame a set of research questions around the data we are using (Access Provided in Private REPO shortly).\r\n\r\n++ Session Two: Team Focused workshops. \r\n\r\n+ Day Three\r\n\r\n++ Session One: Practicing Reflexivity in Learning Analytics. Weaving between SNA Concepts, Group Informatics, and our research questions. \r\n\r\n++ Session Two: Finalizing our Report and Results \r\n",
