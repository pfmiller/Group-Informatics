  "body": "### Welcome to the LASI Social Network Analysis Workshop!\r\n\r\nPrior to the workshop, I ask you to read (or at least scan) four papers of mine which will give you a conceptual overview of how I, as a researcher, apply social network analysis in learning (and other) contexts.  They are listed below:\r\n\r\n  - [Performance and Social Structure in Learning Groups:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/GogginsGalyenLaffey-2016.pdf) \r\n  - [Group Informatics:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/Goggins-2013.pdf)\r\n  - [Group Informatics for user modeling and personalization:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/USER735.pdf) \r\n  - [Network Analysis of Trace Data to Support Group Work:](http://seangoggins.net/sites/default/files/p107-goggins.pdf)\r\n\r\nYou should load, if you can, “R” (r-project.org) and Gephi on your computers https://gephi.org . Also, loading the github client may be helpful for you.  But not necessary. \r\n\r\n[History of Social Network Analysis](http://www.sociallycompute.io/Freeman%202004.pdf)\r\n\r\n",
