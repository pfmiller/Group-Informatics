I have to ensure that I am on the ""first"" page of that lesson, as the edX system keeps you on the last page (which is normally fine if you are just going in order).

The Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately creating the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with its capital at BogotÌÁEcologically, Colombia is considered one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, and of these, the most biodiverse per square kilometer. Colombia is a middle power and a regional actor with the fourth largest economy in Latin America,[4] is part of the CIVETS group of six leading emerging markets and is an accessing member to the OECD.[19] Colombia has a diversified economy with macroeconomic stability and favorable growth prospects in the long run.Colombia is highly impacted by El NiÌ±o phenomenon; El NiÌ±o is defined by prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The U.S NOAA definition is a 3-month average warming of at least 0.5 å¡C (0.9 å¡F) in a specific area of the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean.Climate change has affected significantly the impact of El NiÌ±o due to the warming of the oceans, in this specific case the Pacific Ocean. Thereby, the amount of evaporation on countries like Peru makes the situation worst in countries like Colombia.Currently we are facing of the strongest phenomenon of El NiÌ±o seen in the climate records of Colombia. The main river has decreased in almost 2 meters dept. Cities like BogotÌÁ are having fires in the surrounding mountains, the coast has been suffering the hardest drought in 20 years.The input of energy in form of heat into the ocean has changed climate cycles and has made oceans warmer (and so a larger CO2 emission). It has made the situation even worst and now regions like South America and the pacific are facing one of the strongest cycles of El NiÌ±o.The worst is yet to come, for the warming of the Pacific emits even more CO2 and will make incoming cycles of El NiÌ±o more powerful as in a amplifying feedback.In conclusion it is necessary for the governments of the Americas to deal with the current problematic the world id facing, the impact seen by the change of climate phenomenon has no precedent and will cost vast amounts of money and lives.The loss is biodiversity therefore is one of the main aspects we need to face, for it has no reverse. Loss of virgin forests, parts of the Amazonia and so will make and amplifying feedback due to the loss of CO2 capture and will only worsen the problem."

It produces the frosts at dawn, the mid-day heat and the cooling at sunset. It is regulated by rotation of the Earth.‰Û¬Superimposed on the daily solar cycle is the monthly lunar cycle, driven by the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. These two cycles interact to produce variations in atmospheric pressure and tides, and currents in the oceans and the atmosphere. These are the daily weather makers.‰Û¬The yearly seasonal cycle is caused as the tilted axis of Earth‰Ûªs rotation affects the intensity of solar energy received by each hemisphere. This produces spring, summer, autumn and winter for every spot on Earth.‰Û¬Then there is the 22 year sun-spot cycle, which correlates with cycles of floods and droughts. Sunspot cycles are indicators of solar activity which causes periods of global warming and cooling.‰Û¬Earth‰Ûªs climate is also disrupted periodically by the effects of changing winds, ocean hot spots and submarine volcanism that produce the El Nino Southern Oscillation.‰Û¬The least recognised but most dangerous climate cycle is the glacial cycle. We live in the Holocene Epoch, the latest brief warm phase of the Pleistocene Ice Age. The climate history of the Holocene, and its predecessor the Eemian, are well documented in ice core logs and other records in the rocks. Each cycle consists of a glacial age of about 80,000 years followed by a warmer age of about 20,000 years, with peak warming occurring over about 12,000 years. Our modern warm era commenced 12,000 years ago, so it is probably nearing its end.‰Û¬There have been eight warm eras separated by long glacial winters over the last 800,000 years of the Pleistocene. In every beat of this cycle, the vast ice sheets melt, sea levels rise dramatically, coral reefs and coastal settlements are drowned, and forests and animals re-colonise the higher land released from the ice. Warm climate animals such as hippos, water buffaloes and elephants got as far north as Germany in the last warm era. Then suddenly the ice returned, covering the northern hemisphere as far south as Chicago and London, destroying the forests, lowering the seas, stranding the relocated coral reefs and eliminating unprepared species. (Some dopey grizzly bears got stranded in the Arctic Ice and the most enterprising of them survived to evolve into white grizzlies now called polar bears.)‰Û¬This regular repetition of natural climate change is partially explained by the Milankovitch cycles relating to changes in Earth‰Ûªs precession, orbit and tilt. These drive variations in solar energy received by Earth and have the greatest temperature effect on the large land masses of the Northern Hemisphere.On an even longer time scale, oscillation of the solar system through the plane of the Galaxy seems to trigger magnetic reversals and violent spasms of volcanism, crustal movements glaciation and species extinction. Earth is never still for long.‰Û¬What about the role of carbon dioxide in climate? Al Gore did a great job to dramatise the recurring glacial cycles in his widely acclaimed work of science fiction. But he missed two inconvenient truths.‰Û¬First, ice cores show that in the glacial spring-time the temperature rose BEFORE the CO2 levels rose. Therefore the rising CO2 cannot be a CAUSE of the warming ‰ÛÒ it is a RESULT of CO2 being expelled from the warming oceans.‰Û¬Second, at the top of every summer-time in the glacial cycle, the high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere were unable to prevent the cooling into the next cycle of ice.‰Û¬We are already in the autumn of the current glacial cycle and nothing man can do will change that. Global temperatures today are lower than they were in Roman and Medieval times. They will still fluctuate with the effects of daily, lunar, yearly and sun-spot cycles, but the long-term trend of maximum and minimum temperatures will continue drifting downwards. Once summer temperatures in places like Siberia are unable to melt last winter‰Ûªs snow, the already growing glaciers will join to form ice sheets and Earth will once again be gripped by another long Glacial Winter.The transition from Greenhouse Earth to Icehouse Earth always occurs suddenly. Once our verdant greenhouse is gone, life of Earth will never be the same again.‰Û¬The warm days, seasons, years and epochs have never been a deadly threat to life on Earth. Frost, snow, hail and ice are the killers. If our descendants do not have the energy, resources and wisdom to keep their people warm and fed through the coming glacial epoch, humans may follow our Neanderthal cousins who perished in the last glacial winter, just 20,000 years ago.‰Û¬It is a wonder of the modern era that people who cannot accurately forecast next weekend‰Ûªs weather claim they can regulate the temperature of the whole globe by bashing industry and taxing carbon.‰Û¬There is NO evidence in climate history that carbon dioxide has a detectable effect on global temperatures. However if our continued use of cheap reliable hydro-carbon energy does slightly delay the onset of the next glacial winter, we and all life on Earth should count ourselves extremely lucky.Viv Forbes is a qualified geologist who has spent much of his life studying geological and climate history as written in the rocks.

The hottest year ever! More signs that global warming and its extreme effects are beyond debate, right? Not even close.By Patrick J. Michaels Jan. 24, 2016 2:45 p.m. ET An East Coast blizzard howling, global temperatures peaking, the desert Southwest flooding, drought-stricken California drying up‰ÛÓsurely there‰Ûªs a common thread tying together this ‰ÛÏextreme‰Ûù weather. There is. But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever. It is called business as usual.Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly: They‰Ûªve been going up, in fits and starts, for more than 150 years, or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age. Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up, temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II. They then cooled down a bit, only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ‰Ûª90s, about the same amount as earlier in the century.Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at. Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s, and since then had plateaued in a ‰ÛÏhiatus.‰Ûù There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature.That changed last summer, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided to overhaul its data, throwing out satellite-sensed sea-surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on, among other sources, readings taken from the cooling-water-intake tubes of oceangoing vessels. The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship‰Ûªs infrastructure conducts heat, absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun‰Ûªs energy, and vessels‰Ûª intake tubes are at different ocean depths. See, for instance, John J. Kennedy‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏA review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature,‰Ûù published Jan. 24, 2014, by the journal Reviews of Geophysics. NOAA‰Ûªs alteration of its measurement standard and other changes produced a result that could have been predicted: a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years, erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain. Yet the increase remains far below what had been expected.It is nonetheless true that 2015 shows the highest average surface temperature in the 160-year global history since reliable records started being available, with or without the ‰ÛÏhiatus.‰Ûù But that is also not very surprising. Early in 2015, a massive El NiÌ±o broke out. These quasiperiodic reversals of Pacific trade winds and deep-ocean currents are well-documented but poorly understood. They suppress the normally massive upwelling of cold water off South America that spreads across the ocean (and is the reason that Lima may be the most pleasant equatorial city on the planet). The Pacific reversal releases massive amounts of heat, and therefore surface temperature spikes. El NiÌ±o years in a warm plateau usually set a global-temperature record. What happened this year also happened with the last big one, in 1998. Global average surface temperature in 2015 popped up by a bit more than a quarter of a degree Fahrenheit compared with the previous year. In 1998 the temperature rose by slightly less than a quarter-degree from 1997.When the Pacific circulation returns to its more customary mode, all that suppressed cold water will surge to the surface with a vengeance, and global temperatures will drop. Temperatures in 1999 were nearly three-tenths of a degree lower than in 1998, and a similar change should occur this time around, though it might not fit so neatly into a calendar year. Often the compensatory cooling, known as La NiÌ±a, is larger than the El NiÌ±o warming.There are two real concerns about warming, neither of which has anything to do with the El NiÌ±o-enhanced recent peak. How much more is the world likely to warm as civilization continues to exhale carbon dioxide, and does warming make the weather more ‰ÛÏextreme,‰Ûù which means more costly? Instead of relying on debatable surface-temperature information, consider instead readings in the free atmosphere (technically, the lower troposphere) taken by two independent sensors: satellite sounders and weather balloons. As has been shown repeatedly by University of Alabama climate scientist John Christy, since late 1978 (when the satellite record begins), the rate of warming in the satellite-sensed data is barely a third of what it was supposed to have been, according to the large family of global climate models now in existence. Balloon data, averaged over the four extant data sets, shows the same. It is therefore probably prudent to cut by 50% the modeled temperature forecasts for the rest of this century. Doing so would mean that the world‰ÛÓwithout any political effort at all‰ÛÓwon‰Ûªt warm by the dreaded 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 that the United Nations regards as the climate apocalypse.The notion that world-wide weather is becoming more extreme is just that: a notion, or a testable hypothesis. As data from the world‰Ûªs biggest reinsurer, Munich Re, and University of Colorado environmental-studies professor Roger Pielke Jr. have shown, weather-related losses haven‰Ûªt increased at all over the past quarter-century. In fact, the trend, while not statistically significant, is downward. Last year showed the second-smallest weather-related loss of Global World Productivity, or GWP, in the entire record.Without El NiÌ±o, temperatures in 2015 would have been typical of the post-1998 regime. And, even with El NiÌ±o, the effect those temperatures had on the global economy was de minimis.Mr. Michaels, a climatologist, is the director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute. "

As I understand the concept it is not only about having information on climate change, its causes, effects and consequences, but having an understanding sufficient to critically examine claims, assertions, speculations, and proposed responses. In other words a climate literate person is in a position to actively contribute to the ongoing debate and advocate action. It is regrettable that much discussion on this subject, apart from the scientific community, seems so far to have been ill-informed or partisan, or both.Those who are climate literate know that we are now well beyond the stage of demonstrating human culpability in global warming. The issues to be confronted now are mitigation and adaptation. Can anything be done to reduce the rate of warming and bring it to a halt sooner? Given that warming will continue in the medium term, whatever action is taken, how may human societies protect themselves from its harmful effects? These are questions upon which scientists are uniquely qualified to advise and it behoves politicians to heed their advice.In their book, Burch and Harris assert that ""Tackling the climate change challenge requires the creation of a compelling vision of a desirable future, not just recapturing a mythical past or 'tinkering around the edges' of our current development path."" This seems to me to be a rather profound insight as it speaks directly to what we know about human nature - people rarely change their behaviour in response to threat; they need to have a clear view of how they personally will be better off. A huge shift in cultural tectonics is needed but when has the world ever been better placed, given the ubiquity of modern communications, to achieve such a shift?"

This CO2 will lower the pH of one's bloodstream and will trigger an increase in breathing rate. There are chemoreceptors in the body which force you to breathe after a certain period of time. We then exhale CO2, which in turn lowers the amount in the bloodstream, returning it to a normal, stabilized level. Most physiological changes in the body follow a ""stabilizing"" pattern.Amplifying: (1) If you were to cut a major artery, like the femoral or carotid, your body's barorecepors (pressure) would detect a loss of blood pressure. Trying to keep the brain well supplied with blood, its response would be to have the heart pump faster and harder - causing you to bleed to death faster.Or (2) our psychological/physiological response to narcotic pain killers. People who take Norco/Codeine/Oxycontin will experience a need for a higher dosage over time to achieve the same results. Receptors in the brain decrease in number as the system is flooded with these artificial opiates. Since there are fewer receptors, we need more of the opiate to achieve the same level of pain relief.

Is there a way the course can allow those who missed to receive feedback or a lower grade ? In any event, I am posting my essay here and welcome any feedback my fellow classmates might have. Thank you for this course, the learning opportunity and feedback! South East Florida, composed of Monroe, Miami-Dade and Broward County, home of iconic cities and landscapes such as Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and the Palm Beaches, rests on the lower tip of the Floridian Peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.  The unique position of the peninsula and distinct geological features make the area susceptible to economic, social and environmental stress caused by increased vulnerability to risks linked to Climate Change (CC). Some possible cc risks include increased vulnerability to sea level rise, salt water intrusion, vulnerability to extreme events (hurricanes and other storms), and vulnerability to public health hazards like the encroachment of subtropical mosquito-transmitted diseases like Dengue and the Zitca virus.[1] Though the region faces similar cc risks, the challenges facing each area is unique, therefore this essay will focus on issues in Miami Dade County (MDC) and flooding risks caused by sea level rise.   Research predicts that one of the consequences of climate change include rising sea levels (SLR). As covered in the course, climate change is being driven by an imbalance of energy whereby the energy entering the earth is not balanced with energy reflected back to space, causing increased stocks of energy, present in the form of heat, on the earth‰Ûªs surface. An increased stock of greenhouse gases, believed to be linked to anthropogenic emissions, creates a greenhouse effect that contributes to amplifying feedback loops leading to temperature increases. Temperature increases increase rate of organic decay, melting of ice sheets, warmer currents accelerating ice melt and decreasing permafrost, to name a few. On a global scale, the increased stock of energy is causing temperature increases, which in turn affected hydrological systems, including, what the IPCC identifies with ‰Û÷very high confidence‰Ûª as a projected sea level rise ‰ÛÏthrough the 21st century and beyond [where], coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion.[2] The same report projects that risks will increase as temperatures increase and that an increase above 3C could lead to ‰Û÷irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss‰Ûª of up to 7meters.[3]MDC is particularly susceptible to sea level rise due to its unique geographical and geological position. In South East Florida and MDC, specifically, recent area specific studies by NOAA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published by the South East Florida Climate Compact project that sea level could increase by 6-10 inches by 2030, 14-26 inches by 2060, and 31-61 inches by 2100 (above 1992 average sea levels).[4] A slowing of the Florida Current and Gulf Stream could also amplify regional sea level rise affecting Miami Dade County.[4] Because most of MDC is at or just above sea level, there is increased risk of permanent displacement of flooding damages caused by rising sea levels. An increased stock of water coming from the ocean can decrease the land‰Ûªs ability to absorb water when precipitation occurs because water will be at sea level and less likely to follow current patterns back to the ocean. Flooding can also occur during precipitation, when increased stock of water is more likely to saturate land, less likely to be absorbed and collect, causing flooding. In addition to property damage, flooding can cause other potential problems include damage to key infrastructure such as utilities (water, electricity, and sewage) and infrastructure such as roads and bridges. According to recent studies, four meters in sea level rise is enough to cover all MDC underwater and the highest projected sea level rise of 61 inches by 2100 is estimated to flood 40% of the county.[5] If 40% of the area is flooded by sea there are secondary issues caused by an increased stock of displaced people. In other words, people living on the shoreline will no longer be able to live in areas that become permanently covered in water and will have to move further inland thus increasing demand for space. This could be an amplifying effect because an increased demand for space could lead to increased incursion into the everglades, increasing emissions and increasing area covered by less permeable surfaces such as housing and asphalt. In conclusion, here is ample evidence that climate change is causing sea levels to rise. Rising sea levels increase risk of flooding in low lying areas close to shorelines where sea level rise is projected to cause flooding. References: [1] Lindsay P.

I feel confident that as you read it, in the context of the question above, your understanding will be different from mine. Does it mean 'must' be involved? Does it mean prioritising scientific advice? Does it mean actually being decision makers? And whose 'science' are we talking about?I 'should' of course take more exercise, and eat healthier food, and drink less alcohol. As humans in society we 'should' be more compassionate, more tolerant, more open-minded, and less constrained by our cultural heritage. Scientists as a group would no doubt feel that they 'should' be heard by decision takers, but so would those for whom religion is important, those who are disadvantaged by poverty, or gender, or skin colour. Decision making is a political activity and politicians are notoriously unwilling to look beyond their medium term self-interest. In fact, to be honest, so are we all. And do the public in fact want decision making to be driven by science? A recent IPSOS/Mori poll (https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Infographics/pas-2014-summary-infographic.pdf) suggests that only 55% of those surveyed felt that the benefits of science outweighed any harmful effects. Only 45% felt well informed about science. These findings in an 'advanced' western society, so what price elsewhere?There is evidence that scientific opinion is heard and understood by politicians, but action is a different matter; procrastination is a more likely outcome unless there is an immediate crisis, with potentially disadvantageous consequences, to be resolved. It seems to me that the best scientists as a whole can expect is that they will be heard as one voice amongst many competing for attention. It is important though to keep shouting or else those many for whom rationality is an unfamiliar concept may win the day."

Did global warming contribute to these extreme conditions in Texas?     According to John Nielson-Gammon, Professor of Climatology at Texas A&M University, extreme weather events and their frequency are among the most agreed-upon effects of global warming in all the scientific literature on the subject.(2)  Nielson-Gammon said that the ending of a drought by sudden heavy rains has happened three times in the last 100 years in Texas.  Experts said that things were different this time because of climate change.  Warmer temperatures have exacerbated evaporation on land and pushed more water into the atmosphere which lead to heavier rainfall. (3)  Brenda Ekwurzel, a senior climate scientist at the science advocacy group, Union of Concerned Scientist, believes that global warming contributed to these extreme conditions.  She said that the burgeoning of El Nino and the record breaking ocean surface temperatures in April, 2015, likely revved up the hydrological cycle in Texas.  The warmer atmosphere has the capability to hold more water vapor and when storms organize, more water can be wrung out of the atmosphere than in the past.  Katharine Hayhoe, director of Texas Tech State University‰Ûªs Climate Science Center says that extreme weather events,such as droughts and floods occur naturally in Texas, and that climate change is not causing these extreme events; but climate change exacerbates these weather extremes, causing them to be worse than they would have been naturally.(4)	The National Drought Mitigation Center created a chart describing drought conditions in Texas from January 20, 2015 to January 19. 2016.  On January 20, 2015, 39.80% of the state was considered not to be in a drought condition.   On January 19, 2016, 98.31% of the state was not in a drought condition.(5)The ending of a drought is a normal event, but the ending of a record breaking drought in a matter of weeks is not a normal event.  NOAA compiled precipitation data for a section of the northern part of Texas where two major cities (Dallas and Ft. Worth) are located.  The normal annual rainfall for the region is approximately 34 inches. The annual rainfall for 2015 was 62.61 inches ‰ÛÒ 82% greater than normal. The aggregate for April, May and June in 2015 was around 26 inches with May having the largest amount of rainfall ‰ÛÒ 16.96 inches.(6)	In Central Texas located just out of the City of Austin is Lake Travis, a large reservoir that provides water for Austin and the surrounding area. The lake covers 18,929 acres and has a capacity of 1,953,936 acre-feet. At the end of April, 2015, the water level was at 629.38 feet of water.  On May 19, 2015 the water level stood at 633.56 feet and on May 26, 2015, the water level was 655.52 feet.  This data shows that the lake level rose nearly 22 feet in seven days and 26 feet in about a month.(7)	About 60 miles south of Austin is the town of Wimberley and the Concho River traverses the town.  On May 25, 2015 a major rain event occurred.  In a period of 4 hours 5.97 inches of rain fell.  On the following day the river rose more than 33 feet in just 3 hours, cresting at 27 feet above flood stage.  At this point an all- time record crest was broken by 7 feet.  It is important to know that at this point during the flood, the flood gauge stopped reporting data as the water continued to rise.(8)	The City of Houston, the largest city in Texas, is located just off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  On May 27, 2015, the city received more than 10 inches of rainfall in a 24 hour period causing extensive flooding.(9)	Extreme weather events as those discussed above are normal in Texas, but the intensity of these events is well above normal and average as the data has shown.  Couple the data presented here with the extremely large geographic area that these conditions covered and a case for the influence of climate change on Texas weather can be seen.	SOURCES(1)	http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/global/201512(2)	Satija, Neena and Malewitz, Jim.  http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Climate-Change-Texas-Floods-Largely-Ignored-Lawmakers.html.  2015(3)	Schuppe, John.  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rains-wreaked-deadly-texas-floods-also-ended-historic-drought-n366131.  2015(4)	Harball, Elizabeth and Defrue, Scott.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-may-have-souped-up-record-breaking-texas-deluge/.  2015(5)	http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?TX. 2016(6)	http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/?n=dmoprecip.  2016(7)	Freedman, Andy. http://mashable.com/2015/05/26/lake-travis-rises-22-feet-texas/#PhQkvM4G(8)	Freedman, Andy.  http://mashable.com/2015/05/27/anatomy-flooding-wimberley-texas/#8l(9)	Harball, Elizabeth and Defrue, Scott.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-may-have-souped-up-record-breaking-texas-deluge/. 2015."

Coastal storms or ""nor‰Ûªeasters"", have wrecked havoc on barrier islands along the Jersey Coast.Although a few years before my time, the ‰ÛÏAsh Wednesday Storm of 1962‰Ûù was considered by the U.S. Geological Survey to be one of the most destructive storms ever to affect the mid-Atlantic states. In fact, it has been suggested that this storm was one of the ten worst in the United States during the 20th century. It was responsible for the deaths of 40 people, injured more than 1,000 and caused hundreds of millions in property damage.More recently, Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in Atlantic City around 8:00 p.m. on October 29th, was the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history. $37 billion of its $64 billion in damages occurred in New Jersey. The storm ended as the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, having been measured at 1,100 miles in diameter.Most recently, on January 23, 2016, winter storm Jason pounded the southern New Jersey coast with wind gusts approaching hurricane strength. Many coastal communities witnessed water levels exceeding those of Hurricane Sandy. Several areas throughout the northeast saw more snow from this single storm than that which typically occurs during the entire winter season.Storms such as the ‰ÛÏAsh Wednesday Storm of 1962‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏSuperstorm Sandy‰Ûù are often dubbed ‰ÛÏStorms of the Century‰Ûù. However, due to the serious and significant impacts of climate change, these types of storms are predicted to occur much more frequently.The National Climate Assessment 2014 in a section specifically highlighting the northeastern U.S., notes that ‰ÛÏinfrastructure, agricultural, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised.‰Ûù This report continues in stating that this area of the country has experienced a greater increase in extreme precipitation than any other region. In fact, between 1958 and 2010, the northeast has seen a 70% increase in precipitation falling in ‰ÛÏvery heavy events.‰ÛùThe Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment (NECIA), a collaboration between the Union of Concerned Scientists and more than fifty independent experts, has noted that the northeast has been warming .5 degrees per decade. In addition to an increase in coastal storms, this area will be negatively impacted due to climate change. Under a ‰ÛÏhigher emissions scenario‰Ûù it is estimated that by late in this century, this area will experience summer temperatures between 6 and 14 degrees higher than average. Hemlock, maple, birch, and beech trees would either be eliminated or shift north. Apple, blueberry, cranberry and milk production would decrease while diseases such as West Nile virus and Lyme Disease would increase. Extreme coastal flooding would occur much more regularly. For example, Atlantic City, one town over from my childhood home, would witness ‰ÛÏonce a century‰Ûù flooding occur once every year or two.In an article published in the Boston Globe (May 7, 2014) the authors David Abel and Matt Viser take information from a recent federal report on climate change. They caution that if current rates of emissions continue, the northeastern states will witness extreme heat, taxing electrical systems and disrupted ecosystems. Both coastal and river flooding will increase. In fact, ‰ÛÏheat waves, coastal flooding and river flooding will pose a growing challenge to the region‰Ûªs environmental, social and economic systems.‰ÛùThe barrier island of Brigantine where I was born and raised, is seeking to adapt to the reality of increasingly numerous and dangerous coastal storms by requiring property owners, when initiating property improvements, to increase the height of their bulkheads. This strategy has not only proven to be ineffective but, more importantly, will do little to mitigate the serious dangers that lie ahead. Rather than pursue a strategy of adaptation, it is incumbent upon each individual, municipality, state and country to work cooperatively in the development and implementation of strategies to reduce and prevent the effects of climate change."

Don't read this until you have worked through Sara's lectures in module 3.Once you have worked through Sara's lectures about energy budgets you might find this material interesting. It is more technical than the lectures could be, perhaps more technical than you need or are interested in. However there might be some interest for you.And at the end I can show you a graph, measured from a satellite in 1969, where the effect of CO2 is immediately visible. And it highlights the level of depth and detail to which the scientists understand all this.Lets start with Sara's graph of the spectrum from the Sun and Earth. ![enter image description here][1]As Sara said, Wiens Law lets us calculate what wavelength the peak of the curve will be at based on the temperature of the object radiating. And the Stefan-Boltzmann Eqn tells us the total amount of heat being radiated.This is actually the area under that curve. And there is a 3rd eqn that relates Wien and Stefan-Boltzmann to each other. It is called Planck's Law - this is like a who's who of great 19th century physicists. You can read about it [here][2] - the formula is rather complicated math. Planck's Law describes the shape of the spectrum curve, based on the temperature of the object, Wien's Law works out the location of the peak of Planck's curve, and Stefan-Boltzmann calculates the area under Planck's curve.As an object gets hotter this curve shifts to the left on Sara's graph of wavelengths. From infrared to visible to ultra-violet. And it gets brighter, so the curve grows taller. Importantly however the shape of the curve doesn't change - it slides and stretches but keeps the same shape. When we look at a single object glowing at a certain temperature we expect to see this curve. And most things do look this way, broadly speaking.This is the spectrum for the Sun, measured by satellites. The yellow curve is from above the atmosphere. As you can see it matches the Planck curve Sara showed pretty well. And the orange curve is what reaches the surface, after reflection from the clouds and absorption by the atmosphere. See how much of the ultra-violet is absorbed by the ozone layer, and the absorption by water vapour and oxygen. There is even a tiny bit of absorption by CO2 at a wavelength of around 2000 nanometers - 2 micrometers (microns). This is a tiny contribution from CO2. It's main effect is on radiation going out to space. The main action as far as radiation to space from the Earth is concerned is far to the right off this graph, at wavelengths between around 5000 to 30,000 nanometers (5 to 30 microns)![enter image description here][3]So, in early 1969 NASA launched a satellite, Nimbus 3. It was used to test a range of instruments that could be used for observing the Earth. One of those instruments was a Michelson Infrared Interferometer. A device that could actually measure the infrared spectrum coming up from the Earth - the Planck Curve. In April 1969, months before Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon, an experiment was carried out using the satellite. A weather balloon was launched from near Galveston in Texas on the Gulf of Mexico coast. As it ascended it measured air temperatures, pressures and humidity in the air column above Galveston. And it was launched so that Nimbus 3 was passing overhead as it rose. So Nimbus 3 was looking down at this region at the same time the weather balloon was rising through it.In 1970 a scientific paper was published covering a range of studies using this interferometer, including this experiment. At this point in time they were still evaluating all the things an instrument like this could be used for. So a lot of the paper is quite technical. The paper is called 'THE INTERFEROMETER EXPERIMENT ON NIMBUS 3'. Cited as Conrath et al 1970 [here][4].A dry, dusty name but several graphs from page 54 to 60 are really important.This is the first. Two curves. One is the spectrum from the earth, as measured by the satellite - the range of wavelengths on the graphs isn't the full spectrum, just most of it - it was limited by the range the instrument can measure.The other is the spectrum calculated using the measurements from the weather balloon to provide data for a theoretical calculation using the physics of radiation transfer and the properties of the GH gases. ![enter image description here][5]Basic science. Make a prediction from theory and compare it to observations.As you can see the two curves are very similar, but are one above the other. **This is because the two curves, theory and observations actually matched so well that you almost couldn't tell them apart. So they shifted one of them up by a bit, just so they could be told apart.** Look at the graph below. It shows half the data from the first graph without the vertical displacement. They match almost perfectly.And reading the text of the paper, these results and the degree of agreement between theory and observation didn't surprise anyone. They expected them and were more interested in the fine details of accuracy.Think about this. In 1969, with simpler instruments than today, with far less computer power available, the knowledge of all this was sufficiently well developed that they could get almost everything right and weren't even surprised!So look at the first graph again. They have labelled several regions of the graph - H2O (Water), Ozone, CH4 (Methane). And one called H2O Rotational. This is an aspect of GH gases that Sara wasn't able to mention. Water molecules have a permanent bend in them whereas CO2 is straight when it is at rest and only gets a bend when it vibrates. So water's charge separation that Sara discussed is permanent whereas CO2's only appears when it bends. With a permanent charge separation, it isn't just vibrations of the molecule that can absorb energy, it is also rotations. Water can absorb radiation via vibrations and rotations, and this happens in two different parts of the spectrum.Finally, there is a section labelled CO2. This is the part of the spectrum where CO2 absorbs. It isn't as broad as the H2O parts, but it is very deep. A big chunk taken out of the graph.Now look at the broad shape of the graph and imagine the Planck curve. We can see it there. But pieces of it are missing, like mice have been eating some of the cheese. Remember that the total energy is the area under the curve from the relationship between Stefan-Boltzmann and Planck. So if there is less area under the curve because of what the GH gases are doing, there is less energy going out to space. **This is directly observing the GH effect.** And that deep notch is due to CO2. Sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. So next time you hear a climate skeptic claim that there is no evidence of CO2's role in climate, remember this graph.And this isn't a one off. Satellites have been observing this since 1969. They have observed different parts of the earth to see the differences in this effect from place to place for nearly 1/2 a century.**Some more detail if you want to drill deeper.** Look at the graph above. The region between the two H2O regions, where the word 'observed' is. There are no GH gases mentioned here. This is sometimes called the 'Atmospheric Window'. The region of the spectrum where none of the GH gases are active. Sara mentioned this. In the energy balance graph she showed, there was 40 Watts/M^2 that went straight out to space. That is what goes through this part of the spectrum. What the satellite measured in this part of the spectrum came directly from the surface. And everything else in this spectrum **didn't** originate from the surface. It is radiation from higher in the atmosphere.This Atmospheric Window is important. It allows astronomers to see at least part of the infrared radiation from stars, galaxies etc. from the ground without it being distorted by the atmosphere. And sadly it has military applications. Heat-seeking air-to-air missiles use the atmospheric window to see the radiation from an aircrafts engines clearly without distortion.Now look at the next graph, more detail, this the left hand half of the first graph. Notice how they have plotted the measurements and observations without any displacement. Apart from some small discrepancies, they are almost perfect matches. From the state of science in 1969!![enter image description here][6]Then they have also plotted hypothetical Planck curves for different temperatures - in Kelvin.Look at the region on the right of the notch, the atmospheric window. It lies between the 280 and 300 Kelvin Planck curves. Roughly at around 295 Kelvin - 22 Celsius. Now look at the graph further down. This is from page 60 in the paper and the solid line shows the actual temperatures the weather balloon measured. Heights are given as pressure rather than actual meters because the balloons don't have a radar altimeter and the convention in Meteorology is to describe heights based on air pressure. And near the ground the temperature is roughly 295 Kelvin. We can see the temperature of the ground from the Planck curve!Now look at the other region to the left in the detail graph. Part of the H2O rotational region. The temperatures from the Planck curves vary between 240 and 280 Kelvin. -33 C to +7 C. This reflects the fact that different parts of the H2O spectrum are originating from different heights in the atmosphere. Mainly the middle to lower troposphere. Now look at the CO2 'notch'. The bottom of the notch matches a Planck curve for 220 Kelvin - -53 C. Now look at the balloon data. That roughly matches the temperatures at the 300 to 50 mB pressure levels. The lower Stratosphere where temperatures are at their coldest but stop getting colder with altitude. Now look at the little peak at the centre of the CO2 notch. That has a slightly higher 'planck temperature'. Not because we are lower in the atmosphere; because we are higher. That corresponds to more like 235 Kelvin. From even higher still, in the upper stratosphere where temperatures start to rise again. We can 'read' a spectrum like this to start to understand how the different parts of the spectrum are coming from different heights in the atmosphere. We can look at a spectrum from a hot dry location. The atmospheric window will show the high ground temperature while the H2O sections won't be as different from that because water vapour drops off sharply with altitude. We can look at a spectrum from a hot wet location. Still high temperature observed in the window but the H2O region will be more different because, with more water in the air, you have to go higher and cooler before concentrations drop to allow radiation to space. We can look at a spectrum from the polar regions in winter. Virtually no H2O - it's too cold. And we can see the temperature inversions where the surface is colder than the upper air.We can do all this because we know, in detail, how all this happens in the atmosphere.![enter image description here][7]**Had enough? Or want to geek out even further?**How do we know all of this? Because we know the properties of GH gases in exquisite detail. Not just theory. Observations. The [HiTran][8] Spectroscopic database is one of the most important (although not the only) database of the detailed measurements of the absorption properties of various gases present in the atmosphere. It's current version has data on 42 different gases in the atmosphere including all the major ones. 120 different [isotopologues][9] of those gases. And over 7 million individual absorption 'lines'. The database is currently maintained by the Atomic and Molecular Physics Division, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. However its origins go back to the Cold War, starting with research funded by the US Air Force in the 1950's. They wanted to build air-to-air heat-seeking missiles and needed to understand what happened in the atmosphere. In detail. It has grown from there.It is now used for military purposes; NASA, the European Space Agency etc. use it in all their planetary science work; it is used in a wide range of product developments of commercial products; it is used in understanding how the satellites that measure air temperatures for weather forecasting work. Oh and it is used to understand the GH Effect.The data from HiTran is available to anyone. You can download it. They have a process and a bit of rigmarole but anyone can get it. But it is a VERY big data file with lots of numbers, and what they mean is quite technical. But it ain't secret.This [website][10] offers a convenient interface to HiTran so you can look at just what you might be interested in. Their [Line List Browser][11] lets you extract the HiTran data for any gas, over any range of wavelengths. This is the data for CO2 in the wavelengths we are interested in.![enter image description here][12]Essentially this is how strongly CO2 absorbs at different wavelengths - in serious, serious detail. There are over 90,000 separate lines here. The vertical scale is logarithmic. So the difference between -20 and -22 on this scale is a difference of 100 in strength of absorptivity. Notice that the peak of this graph is a bit below 15 microns. Exactly matching the centre of the little peak in the middle of the CO2 notch in the graph from Conrath et al above!And it goes deeper. SpectralCalc lets one download the [detailed numbers from HiTran][13] for the area you are looking at.It looks like this: 25  562.393650 8.450e-30 3.513e-01.0705.0960 2720.46290.73-.000709       2 1 1 03       1 2 2 02                    P 24e     4377541221 5 4 5 7    94.0   98.0 21  562.399508 3.581e-26 1.021e-01.0725.1000 2925.14990.70-.000678       2 1 1 02       1 2 2 01                    P 20e     5377641827 5 4 5 7    39.0   41.0Oooh Yuck, numbers!!!But in here we have the basic Spectral Intensity, the raw indicator of absorptivity. We have the Einstein A Coefficient, that plugs into Einsteins equations for estimating emission. It includes detailed data used for evaluating how those 90k+ lines get broadened due to collisions, air temperature etc. There is more detail here than any of us can grasp. So, do I understand all of this? Nope. Some yes but this nuts-and-bolts detail is way above my pay-grade. And I haven't even begun to try to delve into the quantum mechanics of why all of this is so - my head would explode.But specialists in these fields do. This is their day job. These folks don't spend their days throwing darts at dart boards and guessing a lot. They work much much harder than that. But maybe we don't understand that.You may not understand all of this - I don't. But some people do. Surely we should listen to them?  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14537208919967842.png  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14537202974513177.png  [4]: http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700022421.pdf  [5]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14537206585666959.png  [6]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14537207842943299.png  [7]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14537218419748102.png  [8]: http://hitran.org/  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopologue  [10]: http://www.spectralcalc.com/info/about.php  [11]: http://www.spectralcalc.com/info/about.php  [12]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14537221021354097.png  [13]: http://www.spectralcalc.com/spectral_browser/db_data.php"

This CO2 will lower the pH of one's bloodstream and will trigger an increase in breathing rate. There are chemoreceptors in the body which force you to breathe after a certain period of time. We then exhale CO2, which in turn lowers the amount in the bloodstream, returning it to a normal, stabilized level. Most physiological changes in the body follow a ""stabilizing"" pattern.Amplifying: (1) If you were to cut a major artery, like the femoral or carotid, your body's barorecepors (pressure) would detect a loss of blood pressure.

However methane leaves the atmosphere within a decade. So, it works out to be about 20 times more potent than CO2 over a 100 year period.However, it seems that we need to act now to prevent climate change and so the 20 year period with a 72 times potency is more pertinent.If correct, the bottom line of these statistics is that methane presents much more of a problem than CO2. http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/But what is creating the most Methane, industry or animal agriculture. The following two sites contradict each other. http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html, says that industry in the USA is the largest source of methane. Whilst the emissions flow chart on this site http://www.skepticalscience.com/animal-agriculture-meat-global-warming.htm, says that agriculture is the largest source of methane.So, my question is, which is the worst greenhouse gas, and what is mostly creating that gas?thanks"

By helping to craft language that appeals to common values--such as stewardship and preparedness--or working with trained spokespeople who can deliver these messages, scientists can help change public perception, thus influencing decision-makers who are beholden to their constituents. Or scientists can directly reach out to decision-makers with curated messaging that might resonate in a particular region/community/census block. None of this is to say that scientists should stop being objective and rigorous in their research; it is merely to say that by pairing the science with the communications needed to make the science resonate, the role of science in decision-making has the potential to improve exponentially.

You added a lot to the class as a whole.  I've done quite a few MOOCs and the TA support and participation here is first rate.Thank you also to all of my fellow students.  I enjoyed reading your essays and learning about climate change in your regions.

I hope to see some of you in the future in other on-line learning communities.  Though this course was a little different for me (my usual areas of study being astrophysics and mathematics) I am really glad I took this one.  This is an election year here in the United States and while I doubt that climate change will be one of the foremost topics, it will come up.

So I‰Ûªll check the nuclear power plants. It looks to predict easily what is going to impact on climate change.As you know, it‰Ûªs the wonderful power energy without co2 in the air. At least it was believed in Japan by the 11th, March 2011. After huge disaster in Fukushima nuclear power plants exploded, we began to know what happened and how we were stupid. So in this model, I checked Nuclear tests, and how many nuclear power plants we have in the past few decades. Then I‰Ûªll predict how it‰Ûªll be going on. At first I checked how many times nuclear tests was repeated in the world.We, Japanese, had a nuclear bomb in 1945. That was the first time to use nuclear power as bomb. First Hiroshima then Nagasaki. When we read and watch documents about those, everybody said they saw mushroom cloud and strong heats. Even now we saw a shadow of humane on the stair belonged building. They said a humane body became a carbonized. It was summer. So many Japanese women wore kimono (called yukata ) and pants ( also called monpe). If yukata had a dark color, it‰Ûªs pattern was printed on human‰Ûªs skin.Or many people couldn‰Ûªt feel at all although their skin was hanging from their arms and faces. We saw the same situation very recent in Syria. Whenever nuclear bomb explodes, a center of the fireball reach a million degrees Celsius, and surface of ground gets to 3000-5000 degrees Celsius.In last decades many countries tried nuclear tests. America--- 1013 times (both nuclear bomb hydrogen bomb) Russia------715 times  ( also both) England----45 times France-------210 times China--------45 times India---------- 2 times Pakistan----- 6 times North Korea‰ÛÓ5 times  South Africa and Israel ----1 Surprisingly some of them were tested in other countries or far away from their own country like Australia, Algeria, Polynesia and Bikini Islands. I thought these tests had effected on sea water temperature.But these tests were stopped after the Limited Ban Treaty in 1963. It was ratified only 3 countries ( America, Russia, England ), then 118. Lastly another treat was ratified in 1996 but it didn‰Ûªt no effect in 2012. Next I‰Ûªll talk about nuclear power plants. Nowadays many countries have nuclear power plants. But after Three Mile Islands disaster, Chernobyl , and Fukushima disaster, many countries changed their mind. Germany and Sweden had already decided to stop their power plants a few years later. How I shamed Japanese government changed their tactics on nuclear power plants. They decided to reuse them and expanded using time from 40 to 60 years.Country name    now they have    under construction    new plantsThe U.S.A         104                1                   32France             58                 1                    1Japan              54                 2                   11Russia              32                10                   24South Korea         21                 5                   11India                20                 5                   58England             19                 0                   10Canada              18                 0                   10Germany             17                 0                    0Ukraine              15                 0                    3China                13                 27                  52Sweden               10                 0                    7 Spain                  8                 0                    0Belgium               7                 0                    0Taiwan                6                 2                     2 Total               402                53                  226Nuclear submarineThe U.S.A      4      Russia       8       England        4             China        4        France       3        India       2Total       25When we use nuclear power plants, we should always use water to cool down its water vapor. Because of this nuclear power plants are constructed near a river and sea. In case of Japan if a million kw nuclear power plant worked, its heat could boil 150L bath for ten thousands family at instantly. So we should cool down this water. A researcher checked this many times. He saidthe temperature in sea around a nuclear power plant went up to 2 Celsius degrees . The difference of 2‰ÛªC brought totally different creatures. Once familiar creatures had gone, new creatures appeared. After Fukushima disaster all new clear power plants stopped, then the temperature went down. New spices went out and familiar creatures came back.Water vapor generates electricity, at the same time it make new water vapor in the sea. It effect on enormous weather. We made a bad circuit.                 "

One person smokes 1499 cigarettes for one year.Carbon is vitally important for earth and life. Carbon follows a certain route on earth and this action called carbon cycle. Carbon cycle is based on carbon dioxide (CO2), which can be found in air in gaseous form and in water in dissolved form.Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which basically means that too much carbon dioxide in air causes the earth to warm up. Humans emit great amounts of carbon dioxide during combustion processes and because of this, the greenhouse effect consisted. The greenhouse effect means that the climate is affected by the concentrations of greenhouse gasses on earthProjecting climate into the future and forecating regional impacts depends on our understanding of the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans and land ecosytemsRespiration Plants (and photosynthetic algae and bacteria) then use some of the stored carbohydrates as an energy source to carry out their life functions. Some of the carbohydrates remain as biomass (the bulk of the plant, etc.). Consumers such as animals, fungi, and bacteria get their energy from this excess biomass either while living or dead and decaying. Oxygen from the atmosphere is combined with carbohydrates to liberate the stored energy. Water and carbon dioxide are byproducts. oxygen + carbohydrate -> energy + water + carbohydrate O2 + CH2O -> energy + H2O + CO2 Notice that photosynthesis and respiration are essentially the opposite of one another. Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with O2. Respiration takes O2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with CO2. However, these processes are not in balance. Not all organic matter is oxidized. Some is buried in sedimentary rocks. The result is that over geologic time, there has been more oxygen put into the atmosphere and carbon dioxide removed by photosynthesis than the reverse. If CO2 concentration increases in the atmosphere because of an increased rate of outgassing, global temperature will rise. Rising temperature and more dissolved CO2 will lead to increased weathering of crustal rocks as a result of faster reaction rates (temperature effect) and greater acidity. Enhanced weathering will use up the excess CO2 thereby cooling the climate. If global temperature cools as a result of some astronomical forcing or tectonic/ocean circulation effect, the lower temperatures will result in lower rates of chemical weathering. Decreased weathering means less CO2 being drawn from the atmosphere by weathering reactions, leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere to increase temperatures. If more rocks become available for rapid weathering as a result of mountain uplift the enhanced weathering will draw down atmospheric CO2 and decrease global temperatures. But the decreased temperatures will slow reaction rates, thereby using less CO2, thus allowing temperatures to moderate. Istanbul‰Ûªs off the record population is over 20 million and there are estimated 3.5 million cars. One person smokes 1499 cigarettes for one year. Burnning coals, smokestacks, exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere.The spesific CO2 molecules that come out of the smokestacks and exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere for only a few years on average but they don‰Ûªt vanish after that time rather, they end up in other parts of the carbon cycle ( most likely absorbed in the ocean or by a plant) Other CO2 molecules are swapping places with those CO2 molecules all the time, but the total amount in the cycle is increasing because of our emissions. The question isn‰Ûªt how long an individual carbon dioxide molecule stay in the atmosphere.. It is how long extra population of molecules sticks around. The answer is that is at least hundreds of years, and that‰Ûªs the period when our climate will feel warming effectPhotosynthesis, respiration and CO2 absorption/release from the ocean surfaces are all examples of natural fluxes of carbon through the Earth's systems. Human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning and deforestation, disrupt this natural flux by releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. When we mine coal and extract oil from the Earth and then burn these fossil fuels for transportation, heating, cooking, electricity and manufacturing, we are effectively moving carbon more rapidly into the atmosphere than is being removed from the atmosphere naturally through the sedimentation of carbon. This causes the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase, which leads to global warming. Also, by clear-cutting forests to support agriculture, we are transferring carbon from living biomass into the atmosphere. Because of this, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is higher than it has ever been Fossil fuels represent carbon storage areas. Carbon that is locked in these fossil fuels does not cycle through the Earth. When humans burn fossil fuels, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The carbon is then free to cycle through the Earth and can upset the natural balance of the carbon available, changing the way that processes occur on Earth.Sources:lenntech.com/carbon-cycle.htmTr.wikipedia.orgHow to change minds about our changing climate: let science do the talking the next time someone tried to tely you... ebook"

I also appreciate the copious references to contradictory opinions. There were some disappointments.   My doubt over the instructor's suggestion of a net energy flux into the earth's system  (input exceeds output)  led to a search for corroboration.   The numbers imply a measurement precision of about 0.2% - dubious to me unless one is using the  same measurement technique for equivalent quantities( say a ruler and a height-not different flavors  of quantities with the same units)So I referred to a published article which addressed my doubts in the  course 'discussion' section. The response -which  I judge  mostly irrelevant- from one of the course 'monitors' - seemed mainly intended to disparage competence of the authors and the journal itself.I maintain that the data for a net imbalance are not reliable.  A more recent article (I have access to the abstract only) may give weight to this.  In ‰ÛÏAn update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations‰Ûù, Graeme L. Stephens et. al. Nature Geoscience  5,  691‰ÛÒ696  (2012) ,  the authors suggest a revision of energy flux input from updated surface and satellite data imaging:‰ÛÏSpecifically, the long wave radiation received at the surface is estimated to be significantly larger, by between 10 and 17 Wm‰öÕ2, than earlier model based estimates. Moreover, the latest satellite observations of global precipitation indicate that more precipitation is generated than previously thought. This additional precipitation is sustained by more energy leaving the surface by evaporation ‰ÛÓ that is, in the form of latent heat flux ‰ÛÓ and thereby offsets much of the increase in long wave flux to the surface.‰Ûù I take this to mean decreased net energy flux into the earth- which seems to be at odds with the net excess energy flux suggested in the course (Of course I should expect the integrity of these authors and the that of the journal to be questioned.)It was additionally disappointing that the competence of that certain eniment physicists (not climate scientists) who challenge climate change orthodogy is questioned rather than their proposed explanations.On another issue: Scientific 'consensus'.  This can be viewed simply as general agreement over the same error.  Early in the twentieth century many competent scientists attempted to demonstrate 'ether' as a medium allowing the proagtion of light -until careful experiments and the explanation of Einstein's special relativity. It may the case that rising global temperatures are accompanied by increased CO2 but in a non causal manner.  I suggest a more careful objective -less religious like -approach is needed.As for me, I have evolved from 'open' to 'less skeptical about the skeptics'."

Carbon follows a certain route on earth and this action called carbon cycle. Carbon cycle is based on carbon dioxide (CO2), which can be found in air in gaseous form and in water in dissolved form.Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which basically means that too much carbon dioxide in air causes the earth to warm up. Humans emit great amounts of carbon dioxide during combustion processes and because of this, the greenhouse effect consisted. The greenhouse effect means that the climate is affected by the concentrations of greenhouse gasses on earthProjecting climate into the future and forecating regional impacts depends on our understanding of the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans and land ecosytemsRespiration Plants (and photosynthetic algae and bacteria) then use some of the stored carbohydrates as an energy source to carry out their life functions. Some of the carbohydrates remain as biomass (the bulk of the plant, etc.). Consumers such as animals, fungi, and bacteria get their energy from this excess biomass either while living or dead and decaying. Oxygen from the atmosphere is combined with carbohydrates to liberate the stored energy. Water and carbon dioxide are byproducts. oxygen + carbohydrate -> energy + water + carbohydrate O2 + CH2O -> energy + H2O + CO2 Notice that photosynthesis and respiration are essentially the opposite of one another. Photosynthesis removes CO2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with O2. Respiration takes O2 from the atmosphere and replaces it with CO2. However, these processes are not in balance. Not all organic matter is oxidized. Some is buried in sedimentary rocks. The result is that over geologic time, there has been more oxygen put into the atmosphere and carbon dioxide removed by photosynthesis than the reverse. If CO2 concentration increases in the atmosphere because of an increased rate of outgassing, global temperature will rise. Rising temperature and more dissolved CO2 will lead to increased weathering of crustal rocks as a result of faster reaction rates (temperature effect) and greater acidity. Enhanced weathering will use up the excess CO2 thereby cooling the climate. If global temperature cools as a result of some astronomical forcing or tectonic/ocean circulation effect, the lower temperatures will result in lower rates of chemical weathering. Decreased weathering means less CO2 being drawn from the atmosphere by weathering reactions, leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere to increase temperatures. If more rocks become available for rapid weathering as a result of mountain uplift the enhanced weathering will draw down atmospheric CO2 and decrease global temperatures. But the decreased temperatures will slow reaction rates, thereby using less CO2, thus allowing temperatures to moderate. Istanbul‰Ûªs off the record population is over 20 million and there are estimated 3.5 million cars. One person smokes 1499 cigarettes for one year. Burnning coals, smokestacks, exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere.The spesific CO2 molecules that come out of the smokestacks and exhaust pipes stay in the atmosphere for only a few years on average but they don‰Ûªt vanish after that time rather, they end up in other parts of the carbon cycle ( most likely absorbed in the ocean or by a plant) Other CO2 molecules are swapping places with those CO2 molecules all the time, but the total amount in the cycle is increasing because of our emissions. The question isn‰Ûªt how long an individual carbon dioxide molecule stay in the atmosphere.. It is how long extra population of molecules sticks around. The answer is that is at least hundreds of years, and that‰Ûªs the period when our climate will feel warming effectPhotosynthesis, respiration and CO2 absorption/release from the ocean surfaces are all examples of natural fluxes of carbon through the Earth's systems. Human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning and deforestation, disrupt this natural flux by releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. When we mine coal and extract oil from the Earth and then burn these fossil fuels for transportation, heating, cooking, electricity and manufacturing, we are effectively moving carbon more rapidly into the atmosphere than is being removed from the atmosphere naturally through the sedimentation of carbon. This causes the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to increase, which leads to global warming. Also, by clear-cutting forests to support agriculture, we are transferring carbon from living biomass into the atmosphere. Because of this, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is higher than it has ever been Fossil fuels represent carbon storage areas. Carbon that is locked in these fossil fuels does not cycle through the Earth. When humans burn fossil fuels, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The carbon is then free to cycle through the Earth and can upset the natural balance of the carbon available, changing the way that processes occur on Earth.Sources:lenntech.com/carbon-cycle.htmTr.wikipedia.orgHow to change minds about our changing climate: let science do the talking the next time someone tried to tely you... ebook"

Around here we didn't enough water to grow rice , so people made many artificial ponds. According to a regional history Himeji clan mede Kako ouike in 1638. This is the first pond in written history. When I checked the number of ponds, I found Hyougo pre. is the top. (43,321). The second is Hiroshima (20,183)(200km away from Himeji by strech). The third is Kagawa in Shikoku island (14,619).(80 km from Himeji). So that I can say these three are almost same area. My point around climate change is that recently we got a rain in one day so much. I think this is a very document why people who lived in this area made so many ponds.In this area they didn't get enough water to grow rice. So they needed to make artificial ponds. 19,Aug. through 20 Aug. 2016 a warm front was keeping on Japan Sea, warm and moistured air flow into it, air was very unstable in Hiroshima pre. At night it rained 101.0 mm in one hour. 217.0 mm in three hours,257.0 mm in 24 hours.This was the worst report in Hiroshima.This caused big landslide disaster which killed 18 people, serious damage 3 people. Not only people it claimed much on their properties and cars.  When I see a graph of average rain fall in Hiroshima, it's 1537.6 mm. They don't have much rain in winter less than 70 mm (Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb.) But during spring and summer each month they have 100-200 mm. So I found 257 mm is the worst document in a day. They have the average of rainfall in a year 1537.6 mm. (1981-2010)Next example is from Kouchi where is next to Kagawa pre. Why I chose here?   Because I have a big impression about here.The top of the rainfall list is 867.0 mm in a day. (19,July,2011) The second is 606.5 mm.(5,Aug.2014) This became 1186.0 mm in three days. The third is 674.0 mm (10,Aug. 2014) This became 918.5 mm in three days. That is to say nearly 1 m depth rainfall in three days. Could you believe it? They have average of rainfall 2547.5 mm in a year. (the average of 30 years 1981-2010). Kouchi is the top of the rainfall list in a year.Let's go back to Tame-ike. I found Tame-ike itself become a cause of a disaster when we have such amount of rainfall. And in case of heavy rainfall, it comes with typhoon. Not only typhoon itself become stronger than before, but also heavy rain and strong wind give us a huge damage.When I was child, strong typhoon was about 950-960 hPs.Nowadays we can have a typhoon less than 900hPs. It's incredible for me. I can't imagin its'strength. Resercher said that because of El Nino. It's one of the famous climate change.El Nino causes everything,resercher says.El Nino and La Nino means more extream weather grobaly. We just know where the events may happen.Because of these, we can say grobal warming is clear. In the El Nino sea water become warmer year by year.Then they make much water vapor. Water vapor is the top of greenhouse gases. The energy trapped by water vapor is shown southern to northern latitude, peaking near the equater. Water vapor trap alot of energy.( 1.8 Farebheite means water vapor trap extra 2 watts of energy.) These secondary changes are called climate feedback and they could be more than double the amount of warming caused by carbon dioxcide alone. Average residence time of water vapor molecule is 9 days. If greengas concentrations stabilized today,the planet would continue to warm about 0.6'c over next century. Another reason to make sea water warm is maybe because of nuclear power plants.After 2011 Tohoku Disaster all nuclear power plant stopped in Japan.In this time assistant professor checked sea water temprature near the Fukui pre.He found the temperature around them came back normal. It means sea water became 2'C cooler before the disaster. He said because of 2'C difference made impact on sea creatures and sea plants.Referencestodo-ran.com/t/13622 (the average rainfall in a year)20140820-sokuhou.pdf(19-20 Aug. 2015.Hiroshima disaster)http://www.inamino-tameike-museum.com/pdf/08_11/003.pdfhtts://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67uBqpgNMOhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9Tg6mjcunk&feature."

Perspective of Latin America and the Caribbean.The summit of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, where diplomats, politicians, scientists, journalists and representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 179 countries they came together in a plural effort to establish a synergy between human socioeconomic activities on the environment and vice versa, and international action based on the liability of the environment and the economy were established.From the late '80s, depletion of economic models and social organization, poverty and social inequality, joined other issues that had not had much to talk about before, I mean environmental guidelines and environmental to achieve sustainable and equitable growth for the next years.The great environmental impact relating to the increase in industrial production based on the extraction of natural resources to increase the wealth and overcome the effects of poverty and marginalization (eg) ecosystem damage was analyzed.Making an evaluative analysis of sustainability in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1992, it has potentially large dynamic participatory by countries and civil society. In purely economic terms, the 80s was a deep dive into economic reforms centered on trade liberalization and capital flows with the foreign market, it was not until the early 90s when production activity grew and slowly recovering. The social situation in Latin America and the Caribbean in the 90s was a progressive demographic transition and aging population, poor job creation, a negligible reduction in poverty and a wild increase in social inequality. As for the environmental sector, not pipe pollution abandon, on the contrary, the pollution of water, soil and air is increased due to an unplanned and over-harvesting (UNEP, 2000) urbanization.Environmental regulatory frameworks took weight through an evolutionary process from the Rio Summit in 1992 to date (UNDP, 1999), making significant progress and importance in environmental impact assessments, rate of pollutants, land management, new offenses and legal responsibilities to environmental offenses. The summit also marked a historic precedent in the agreements between nations in comprehensive issues of national and global environmental issues, having a vision of broad and ambitious sustainable development, consolidating a universal political response with full cooperative environmental dimensions.From the Stockholm Conference, which opened a prelude to the celebration of the Rio summit, the perception of a global environmental crisis is an inexorably changed. That technocratic vision of the problems, in which case would be solved by themselves to scientific development for sustainable development, it was only a fleeting dream, where there is no room for environment and development as a preemption or inequality of a concept to another, since the former is merely the failure of the second, this means that environmental issues are just the problems of development.One of the many problems that exist at present and whose perception can be understood as a challenge on the road to Johannesburg is globalization. Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, states:The past decade reveals how millions of people around the world have been experiencing globalization not as an agent of progress but as a disruptive and even destructive force, while many millions more have been absolutely excluded from its benefits ... Globalization has been seen by many to be inevitable. While its main engine is technology and the expansion and integration of markets, it is also correct to note that globalization is not a ""force of nature"", but the result of human-driven processes. It is at that precise meaning to be tame for the service of humanity. To do this, it needs to be carefully managed, nationally, by sovereign countries, and internationally, through cooperation. (Grunberg and Khan 2000).Talked about environmental policies and institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean since the Rio Summit in 1992, we will begin to differentiate sustainable development with environmental management, although the former requires the second is not the same. In the dream towards ecological sustainability for Latino and Caribbean, it is true that environmental management has evolved considerably with the creation of laws, regulations environmental policies, institution, etc., even the facts demonstrate devastas ecology, which increases continuously, but why is this possible if there is a broad legal framework? While the legislation is adequate, although advances in the field have not been enough to stop the inertial exploitation of natural resources to acquire wealth, coupled with exaggerated demand and consumption.We distinguish between the main developments after the Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1992) in environmental management consecration of an environmental Constitution, creating new environmental standards and upgrade existing ones, policy with senior environmental, expanding environmental agenda related to the agreements reached at the Rio summit, the creation of environmental ministries and councils, environmental impact assessments, progress in land management, introducing new economic instruments and introduction of new management tools , among others.After Rio, government representatives from Latin America and the Caribbean took a language of sustainable development in official documents. However, in many countries it has only taken a symbolic value, since in recent decades, environmental issues in fundamental and sectoral policies is a very shy topic as wrongly governments face this issue by relying on the belief that it is a limitation development and therefore, as a matter of low priority at the time of combining strategies aimed at overall economic development.Increased social participation in decisions that affect a healthy environment has grown exponentially because all countries incorporate mechanisms that integrate people into a sustainable perspective, doing more democratic Latin American societies, which has brought modernization and genuineness of ancestral authoritarianism. This movement, which emerged after the Rio summit, thousands of NGOs were open endless possibilities for social participation, creating national and international networks of technical and financial support for environmental causes. From this context, one can say that participation and strengthening civil society is the means for creating political will. An important issue discussed during the Rio Summit was Sustainable Consumption, identified as a key challenge to achieve sustainable development, because the consumer is a potential threat to the environment, polluting the air, rivers, lakes, seas and soils , leading to the inevitable destruction of ecosystems, reducing the quality of visa worldwide. Symposium Oslo in 1994 and adopted by the third session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD III) in 1995 states that sustainable consumption is: Use of goods and services that respond to basic needs and provide a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources, toxic materials and emissions of waste and pollutants throughout the life cycle, so that does not jeopardize the needs of future generations. Agenda 21 and the United Nations Recommendations for the Protection of the consumer, identify themselves as government obligations, minimizing the use of resources, promote government leadership and reinforce the values, all these issues related to consumer product a sustainable vision. Making an analysis in Mexico regarding the policies of ""sustainability"" and its development trends, we can say that as a country has undertaken many actions and trends that put it on par with other countries in Latin America. Mexico has a secretariat devoted entirely to environmental issues (Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, SEMARNAT), has designed and promoted laws, regulations and standards, as well as projects and environmental management programs.Environmental education is a vital player to sustainable development, according to SEDEMA, environmental education is a training process that allows awareness of the importance of the environment, promotes the development of citizenship values and new attitudes that contribute the rational use of natural resources and solving environmental problems we face in our city. Environmental education is a milestone in the global meeting in Stockholm in 1972, where one hundred three member states of the United Nations and more than four NGOs implemented a program related to the knowledge of the environment for the improvement and development of natural resources the present and future generations. The UNEP launched an International Programme for Environmental Education, a fundamental fact which opened doors to regions of Latin America and the Caribbean to implement a model of ""eco"", which was launched from strategic locations; institutions, communities and schools. In terms of human mobility, the studies are not very specific, however, migration studies should include a dimension in which the historical relationship between man and nature is related. The term of population mobility impacts directly to environmental change, including urbanization, shifts back and forth and tourism, which can change the perspective of the relationship between native peoples and their ancestral and cultural relationship with nature. Mobility (or migration) involves many environmental, social, political and economic changes.In the framework of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, adopted in Rio in 1992, the harmful effects of greenhouse gases (GHG) were established, so that climate change and energy development were key points during this summit. It was established that the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere damage the global climate system, so that the Kyoto Protocol was established in 1977, settling in the tools needed to reduce GHG emissions on a global scale. Despite setting the established responsibilities in the Kyoto Protocol, Latin America as part of the developing world has contributed very little to the contribution against climate change, measured in terms of GHG, and despite the lack of responsibility of developing countries, unfortunately they are more likely to suffer the effects of climate change because of their greater vulnerability. CO2 emissions, a greenhouse gas, from the burning of fossil fuels globally, increased from 14.7 gigatonnes (Gt) in 1971 to 21.3 Gt by 1990. From 1990 to 1999 the increase amounted to 23.2 Gt. In Latin America these figures are disturbing, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have risen by 33% from 1990 to 1999, while emissions in the United States have grown only 15% during that period. The key indicators for the control of emissions of carbon dioxide from 1990 to 2100 are; to population density, gross domestic product, the intensity of energy consumption, the rate of carbonization of the energy sector and carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector.Global climate change a very serious problem in many countries, including those belonging to the American continent faced. Research related to this phenomenon and can demonstrate the man's hand as an important contribution of this phenomenon, mainly led to the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere factor, which causes overheating of the earth's surface, the responsibility of problem is very clear, since 90% of greenhouse gases come from industrialized countries (Smith, 1991), but regions like Latin America contributes globally to only 4% of total GHG emissions, in addition to all its emissions historical have been much lower than that of industrialized countries. Most greenhouse gases are caused heavy deforestation of forests for agriculture and the timber industry. In a study to Mexico, if concentrations of CO2, about 70% of the land area and its forests are duplicated would be severely affected (Villers and Trejo-VÌÁzquez, 1998).Analyzing the case of forests in Mexico, even though these are killed for holding, it is estimated that even 69% of the land area (135.1 million hectares) is covered by natural vegetation, of which 42,700,000 ha are forested (SEMARNAP, 2000), from a viewpoint of biodiversity, Mexican forest ecosystems are unparalleled worldwide bilÌ_gico resort, however in recent years, deforestation in Mexico has been a very strong problem especially rural zones.According to the newspaper Forest Inventory (1994), Mexico has about 53 million native forests, of which 40% are regulated use, this percentage, about 71% of this area belongs to ejidos, 14% is held communally and 15% of small private properties (SEMARNAP, 1994). In the 90 timber production associated with these areas of forests increased from 7.4 to 8.5 million m3 reported in 1999. Throughout 1990 and 2000, the trade balance went from $ 649 to 1.700 million (SEMARNAT / CONAFORE 2001 ).Most alterations to the planet, was reflected in the second half of the twentieth century, this was a time when there was a great impact on the loss of natural ecosystems and environmental services demanded of them, including forests. The causes are linked to various phenomena, including demographic, productive, environmental, economic, commercial, social, cultural and political issues, all related to a lack of planning with a sustainable vision, generating severe impacts on nature, in Latin America, including Mexico, have lost more than a third of terrestrial natural ecosystems, however it is the region which has more closed and most biodiverse forests. Within the productive effects, agriculture, covering a large section of the regions of felled timber is, so it is proposed globally, an agro-ecological perspective to maintain an environmentally sound agriculture and socially just in Latin America, affecting main positive way small farmers living in marginal environments, but may produce a lot of food sovereignty required for food, based on new technological approaches and supports local governments and NGOs to establish a food security at household level, regional and national levels.The situation of agriculture in Latin America, from the Rio Summit has worsened; 73 million of the 123 million people living in rural areas still live in poverty, and farmers remain marginalized by advances in technology, such as in Mexico, less than 12% of farmers adopted improved crop varieties and only 25 % include fertilizers to land, in other words, Mexican farmers are still driving low-input technology systems, which favors low production. They should implement agro-ecological methods in vulnerable agricultural sectors, which have achieved favorable results even in adverse situations. This potential includes a significant increase in production has 4 times, increased stability by diversifying water and soil improvement in diet and contribution to food security. Finally, note that the problems of sustainability that Latin American countries face are many and complex, so you should seek optimal strategies for effective and fast forward, responding in a decisive manner the increasing demand of the population . It should seek and implement information technology to reach the population concerning the environment and the sustainability of development, since the information found in our countries is degraded, scattered and small, with very little focus on environmental objectives.Referencias:Grunberg, I. y S.

One part of it, doesn't know, ***unlike us***, what is happening with global temperature and what components within the atmosphere causes it, and the another part, is trying to counteract it, fighting against *political powers*. Obviously, political powers know what is affecting the global temperature but they always blame CO2. Why? Because the society doesn't read or doesn't care about, at least. Why I've said this? Because my country is facing *the peace process*, and one part of the society has never read about it, and what restrictions or key points have been taken. The remaining part wants to reach the end of the armed conflict. More of 50 years of conflict. I want it.On the other hand, there is no relationship between ozone depletion and global warning. Why? It is clear that water vapour is the main actor here. The ozone layer has been decreasing because my field used substances such as CFC (Chlorofluorocarbon), HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) and other substances like Asahiflon, Daiflon, Eskimo, FCC, etc[1]. When these substances are released within the atmosphere, reacts with the ozone and causes its destruction. Therefore, these substances had to be replaced.I am now working on how to counteract the climate change and what kind of components we can use to manage the ozone. This course have been very, very interesting for me and everything I have could learn. Thank you to the members who wants to discuss in this forum.References,[http://www.theozonehole.com/cfc.htm][1]  [1]: http://www.theozonehole.com/cfc.htm"

Error estimates are not provided in the course or in the 2009 paper (that I could find) where the updated numbers originate.It's important because class questions using this updated chart are used to prove there is an energy imbalance of 0.9W/m-squared due to the greenhouse effect.  If accurate within the error estimates then that's very compelling evidence supporting the theory of human-caused global warming. It's necessary to AGW theory that the imbalance exists.However, the imbalance is so small that I got the question about the energy balance at the TOA wrong because I used the rounded figures. (I didn't notice the figures out to tenths of a watt at first)Natural effects, such as solar TSI cyclically varying by about 1W/m-squared, could affect the result, especially given the short time period the data was collected.Why aren't all the figures in the chart expressed out to tenths? Without that level of accuracy, the TOA imbalance is undetectable. I'm puzzled... The chart used in IPCC AR4 showed no imbalance at all. It was based on empirical data collected in the late 1980s when the temperature was rising and therefore there should have been an imbalance.The updated chart, however, uses empirical data collected in the first few years of the 2000s when there was very little temperature rise and, thus, should have shown less of an imbalance.How is that explained?

I had a look around the UCAR website that the Flash model is on and I found a page that described the equations that are behind the model, and I thought I might have a go at implementing my own version of the model in an Excel spreadsheet.The details of the equations (there are quite simple) are here: http://eo.ucar.edu/staff/rrussell/climate/modeling/co2_climate_model_activity.htmlYou can download my version in an Excel spreadsheet from my website here: http://www.astro-sharp.com/temp/ubcx/VerySimpleClimateModel_1.xlsxThere are 2 sheets in the Excel workbook. The main one is called 'Model' and this is where the figures of CO2 level and temperature are calculated according to the equations on the UCAR website and there is also as chart. The secind sheet called 'Parameters' has the various input values that the model needs. You can change these and see the effect on the figures in the model.It  looks like the proper version on the UCAR website has got some more refined factors in the model because the CO2 levels go down over the years if you set the CO2 emissions parameter to zero, whereas in my simple version they just level off.I found it interesting that the equations are not fundamental physics like the Stefan-Boltzmann law for example but rather there are empirical equations based on observations and measurements.It took about an hour to do this - feel free to add more sophistication into it. I'd like to add the function so that the model represents the absorption of CO2 by the oceans for example.Ian"

How do you define ""top of the atmosphere"". Is it the top of the Exosphere, which I understand to be the highest atmospheric layer? Or is it the top of the Thermosphere?  The Mesopause was defined as the edge of space around 60 years ago by Theodore von KÌÁrmÌÁn. If the Mesopause is the top of the atmosphere the profs temperature estimate is off by a long shot because the temperature there is around 173å¡K, not the 255å¡K given as an answer. The mesopause happens to be the coldest point in the atmosphere. So which is it that she is referring to? I ask that because specifics are important since these layers have vastly different heights and conditions but also because the NASA graph below also contradicts the temperature estimates she gave as the answer.

Because I am certain I wont be the only person to use that example let me present one more. The biological amplifying feedback present in the drive to feed a new born child. The birth itself creates and increase in hormones that allow for the production of breast milk. The birth of the child and its subsequent hunger increases hormone production increasing the stock of milk in the body. An example of stabilizing feedback I am most familiar with is the predator/prey relationships present in the Lotka-Volterra Model. i.e the relationship between wolves and moose. Moose births increase leading to more food for the wolves, as a response the wolf population increases. There are now too many wolves for the prey population to handle so prey dramatically drops. Once this happens the predators follow closely the curve of their preferred prey. (Of course there are many details left out here, this biological system isn't closed and influx and out of individuals may alter the results a bit) but essentially they stabilize each others population at a basic ""tolerable level"" maintaining a semblance of order and establishing the carrying capacity of each species in a particular area.

Make sure to check them out as they contain important information!![enter image description here][8]**Finding new content in long threads**In some posts with many responses and comments it can be difficult to locate new content via scrolling through it. What you can then do is to use your browser‰Ûªs search function by hitting CTRL+F. In Firefox a search box will be displayed e.g. at the bottom of the window: ![enter image description here][9]Depending on how long ago you last checked a post, you can now search for ‰ÛÏhour‰Ûù, ‰ÛÏminute‰Ûù or ‰ÛÏday‰Ûù to find recent updates.![enter image description here][10]**Looking for posts with specific content**You can use the search box to see if others have already posted about something you‰Ûªd like to discuss:![enter image description here][11]You can also look for posts by one of your coursemates by entering her/his username:![enter image description here][12]If you click on the highlighted bar, you‰Ûªll end up at the overview page listing all posts and comments by the student.**Follow links from posts with the CTRL-key clicked**If you just click on a link within a forum-post, the page will be opened in the same tab. If you then use the back-function to go back to the forum-post, the edX platform always does a page refresh which loses any restrictions you may have had set previously via the drop-downs and revert back to ‰ÛÏAll discussions‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏShow All‰Ûù.**Creating a new post (edX-lingo for thread)**![enter image description here][13] - (1) Click on the ‰ÛÏNew Post‰Ûù button from any forum page;  - (2) decide if it‰Ûªs going to be a question or discussion;  - (3) select the relevant sub-forum via the ‰ÛÏTOPIC AREA‰Ûù list;  - (4) give your post a meaningful title;  - (5) as you add your post, remember that you can add text formatting, pictures, links, quoteboxes, etc. to enrich your content; and   - (6) finish by clicking ‰ÛÏadd post‰Ûù.**Options available for a post**The options available depend on whether it‰Ûªs your own or a coursemate‰Ûªs post, but you have up to three options available:![enter image description here][14]You can upvote a post or response a coursemate posted by clicking on ‰ÛÏ+‰Ûù.

Unfortunately, this sets a flag but doesn‰Ûªt tell us why it was reported as the edX-forums don‰Ûªt yet have a means via which you can add a comment only visible to staff explaining why you flagged something.Hope this helps!*Thanks to Denial101x for permitting us to adapt this content for our course*  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449324734534532.png  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449325714147881.png  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449325919624884.png  [4]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449327342152166.png  [5]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1444932751606730.png  [6]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449327657046905.png  [7]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449327774295893.png  [8]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449327942689081.png  [9]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449328423509128.png  [10]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449328564217745.png  [11]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449328766652387.png  [12]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449328928047961.png  [13]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449329179281049.png  [14]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1444932932633575.png  [15]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449329518432852.png"

Human beings are the main actors who are depleting the ozone layer. Haman beings  are degrading the environment. Science is progressing day by day and new discoveries are happened. A lot of heavy rocket launchers are damaging the ozone layer.

As a result we have political parties with conflicting policies on climate change. The fact is civilised societies have evolved ""scientific method"" - the intellectual process of observation, measurement, hypothesis and testing and adjustment. Over a century ago science explained ""the greenhouse-effect"" in which a trace amount of CO2 enabled earth's temperature to stay within a range which supported the evolution of humans. The IPCC shows us with virtually certainty that human activity is now very rapidly elevating CO2 levels and global temperature to levels unprecedented in the last 800,000 years.

These videos were made just prior to the latest IPCC report and we used data available up to that time, which was maximum 2013 (NASA's animation of the temperature anomalies goes to 2011 - I haven't found an update of that animation - If you do, let me know!).  About ""2003"", that was in reference to Naomi Oreskes' original study of the scientific literature showing the consensus.  She evaluated the literature up to 2003, which was a good choice at the time she did the study.  In section 1.2, activity 6, you can find a link to a more recent paper, by John Cook and others, who did something very similar to Oreskes, but evaluated more literature and for a later time period.  Their results support Oreskes' original work.  The fundamentals of climate science - how Earth's climate system works - have not changed dramatically in the past few years, but you're right, the data do keep piling up!Hope this helps,Sara Harris"

Day to day and week to week and year to year anomalies do not equate to climate change per se. We had a cold blast come through Chicago recently (thanks Canada!) and I'm sure warming deniers were saying things like ""this surely disproves global warming"". It is equally erroneous to say that a warm day in Alberta in January proves that global warming is happening, or even less so that humans are the cause. I think we need to see trends lasting decades at a minimum. And since human population has only exploded recently (we had about 630 million on Earth at the time of Declaration of Independence), our use of fossil fuels all falls within a pretty small geological time period.And your comment suggests another problem. I enjoy the warming effects. I'm from Wisconsin, and I would love 40s in January (F, not C). I think many people in the upper latitudes feel the same way."

Here is a passage, this first part of which is the methodology. MethodsAt the Bern laboratory, four to six samples of approximately 8 grams from each depth level (0.55m intervals) in the ice core are crushed under vacuum conditions. The sample container is connected to a cold trap for several minutes to release air from the clathrates and the air is then expanded to a measuring cell where a laser measures absorption in a vibration‰ÛÒrotation transition line of the CO2 molecule. Calibration is done using a CO2-in-air standard gas of 251.65 parts per million by volume (ppmv) scaled on the WMO mole fraction scale. At Grenoble (Laboratory of Glaciology, Geophysics and Environment) one to three ice samples of about 40 grams each are crushed under vacuum conditions, and after about 20 minutes the extracted gas is expanded in the sample loop of a gas chromatograph and analyzed. Depending on the amount of extracted air, three to five successive analyses are done. To avoid possible effects of water-vapor interference, the CO2 ratio is calculated as the ratio of the CO2 peak to the air (O2 + N2) peak. Calibration is done using an Air Liquide standard scaled on CSIRO standards (172.8 ppmv, 260.3 ppmv, and 321.1 ppmv). Uncertainty is a few ppmv; measurement error for the Bern laboratory is given in the data file, and the Grenoble Lab generally compares within a few ppmv for the common time interval.Temporal UncertaintyTemporal uncertainty of the EPICA 800,000-year series increases with core depth, but estimates indicate that it is usually less than 5% of the true age and is frequently much less than that. The most recent ""EDC3"" chronology is based on a snow accumulation and mechanical flow model combined with a set of independent age markers along the core, indicating either well-dated paleoclimatic records or insolation variations. See Parrenin et al. (2007) for more detail. The Vostok time scale is based on the the ""GT4"" chronology, derived in a similar fashion to ""EDC3"" with age constraints at 110 thousand and at 390 thousand years ago which are assumed to match known events in marine sediments. See Petit et al. (1999) for more detail.TrendsOver the last 800,000 years atmospheric CO2 levels as indicated by the ice-core data have fluctuated between 170 and 300 parts per million by volume (ppmv), corresponding with conditions of glacial and interglacial periods. The Vostok core indicates very similar trends. Prior to about 450,000 years before present time (BP) atmospheric CO2 levels were always at or below 260 ppmv and reached lowest values, approaching 170 ppmv, between 660,000 and 670,000 years ago. The highest pre-industrial value recorded in 800,000 years of ice-core record was 298.6 ppmv, in the Vostok core, around 330,000 years ago. Atmospheric CO2 levels have increased markedly in industrial times; measurements in year 2010 at Cape Grim Tasmania and the South Pole both indicated values of 386 ppmv, and are currently increasing at about 2 ppmv/year."

But actually there are several different cycles with different periods - 100,000 years, 41,000 and 22,000 primarily. And the pattern seems to be an interaction between them. In more recent periods the 100k period has dominated although the 22k period seems to modulate that. Going back to older than the ice cores, up to 3 million years ago the cycles seem to have been dominated by the 41k  cycle. The oldest part of the ice core record may reflect a transition between those two states."

How much does it cost a citizen of each country? (Since tables don't work very well on EdX I have made them into images)Firstly the major contributors and their populations and thus contribution per capita. There are also contributions from the EU as a whole so their citizens all contributed to that, and also the UNFCCC, UNEP and WMO, so all countries contributed to their budgets.Although these were contributions over a couple of decades, using current populations still gives a rough indication of relative per capita contributions. Note the big contribution from Japan to support the IPCC's TFI Technical Support Unit, and the US contribution for translation and publishing.![enter image description here][1]So now lets rank them by per capita contribution:![enter image description here][2]Next lets factor in relative per capita income per country in purchasing power parity to sea how much of an impost this is relative to how wealthy different countries are and reorder them by contribution as % of per capita GDP - how much 'pain' it causes each citizen.. ![enter image description here][3]So people have each contributed sums of maybe 10 or 10's of cents over a couple of decades! For most people, less than 1 cent a year!And it looks like the Scandinavians, Japan & Switzerland are the ones doing the heavy lifting, US is just part of a middle pack, and the Mediterranean countries aren't pulling their weight.But an average Dane is doing 5.5 times as much as an American or Australian.

It can be done in a lab, it not on a large scale, or a scale large enough to make a difference. CCS (carbon capture and sequestration) on a coal electricity plant might work on a large scale because the CO2 concentration on the smoke stack is about 10%. That said, coal CCS has only been tested on a small scale and it is not cost-effective without lots of government subsidies. In other words. coal with CCS and without subsidies is much more expensive than renewable energy. So coal with CCS might never actually happen.The long-term hope for removing CO2 is bio CCS, where we grow trees, burn them for energy, and then use CCS to bury that CO2. But we are talking about real science fiction at this point. We would need to grow trees on a land mass the size of India, and use technology that does not exist, and the cost might be so high as to destroy the global economy.That's why scientists tell us to keep CO2 out of the atmosphere. It's far, far easier to do than get it out later."

Almost everyone answered ""in the summer"". In reality we are closest to the Sun in January, and furthest away in July. The heating that we experience in the summer months has more to do with the angle of incidence of the Sun's rays, and not our proximity to the Sun. That tilt gives rise to our seasons. I understand that there is a certain amount of ""wobble"" to our Earth's rotation, and that this is in part responsible for anomalies in Earth's heating.But to answer your question, no, I don't think an inch either way will have much of an affect. My opinion is that the albedo, or amount of reflectivity, could very well have a larger and larger affect on the warming budget. Land masses that were formerly covered with snow and ice would reflect the majority of sunlight that hit them (90% reflected). Overall, the Earth's albedo is about 0.3 (30%) meaning 30% of the Sun's energy is reflected back. If more land mass is brown and green instead of white, that global average albedo may very well change."

Think of it this way. The strength of the suns radiation falls in proportion to the square of the distance from it. We are, on average, around 150,000,000, 000 meters from the sun. So if that were to fall to by a meter, the difference would be    (149,999,999,999/150,000,000,000) ^2so 0.000,000,000,001,333 times hotter. Only 0.000,000,000,453 watts/M^2 more. The normal eccentricity of the Earth's orbit now, the difference between how close the earth is to the sun at it's closest and at its farthest is around 5 million kilometers and that only produces our normal seasonal variations."

A neophyte myself, I aspire to get up your height of scary-wide view of this world.I have, however, a few comments about your grammar because I misstepped several times during my reading. Not to be a grumbler, but you have lots of distracting sentence fragments in your writing, which are best avoided if you want your readers‰Ûª sustained attention. Furthermore, you have no dashes in your essay but instead rely on weaker forms of punctuation (and your sentence fragments), which in places muddles things a bit.

Climate scientists evaluate media reports about climate change, give them an overall credibility rating, and add comments and explanations to specific and highlighted passages. It's a collaborative and almost real time effort and once complete will show up on their list of feedbacks:http://climatefeedback.org/feedbacks/They make use of ""Hypothesis"" a neat online commenting tool for which you can download and install a ""bookmarklet"" in your browser:https://hypothes.is/Once you have that, you can check any article if comments have already been added.It's really neat and I'm guessing that chances are fairly high for Michaels' article to show up in the not too distant future. In the meantime, check out the feedbacks posted thus far. You'll notice that they also evaluate articles from folks like Chris Mooney and Justin Gillis who have been writing high quality articles about climate change for years.Hope this helps!"

To quote Trenberth:> It [El Nino] really refers to a warming of the central and eastern Pacific. Prior to El NiÌ±o there is a buildup of heat in the ocean...during El NiÌ±o, that heat spreads across the Pacific, it comes back into the atmosphere mainly in the form of, well, cooling the ocean but evaporative cooling of the ocean and then moistening of the atmosphere and then that moisture gets caught up in weather systems and invigorates weather systems around the world and especially in the Pacific and that gives back the heat to the atmosphere that went into evaporating the atmosphere in the first place. And so there is a mini global warming in the latter stages of an El NiÌ±o event and so this El NiÌ±o has also contributed to 2015 being the warmest year on record, actually by far.  [1]: http://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=16-P13-00004&segmentID=2"

Non-Hydraulic cement can't set under water - it needs the excess H2O to be evaporated then needs exposure to the air as a source of CO2.Pozzolanic cements and Portland cement are more complex critters with other minerals added to give it better and different properties. The chemistry of Pozzolanic cements - the stuff the Romans used - is fairly well understood. Portland Cement isn't fully understood but it does begin with the first heating phase from limestone. And Pozzolanic and Portland Cement can set under water. They don't simply involve the recreation of Calcium Carbonate which would be carbon neutral. They involve reactions between calcium hydroxide and other minerals which don't necessarily draw any CO2 back. But they produce more versatile mineral mixes rather than just Calcium Carbonate.So simple cement is carbon neutral, chemically, but not a really useful construction material. Pozzolanic and Portland cements are way, way more useful. We built our world with them and the ancient roman world is still standing because of them - but they aren't carbon neutral.So all cements could benefit from finding renewable energy sources for the heating phase. Then we need to find some different chemistry to reduce/remove the non-carbon neutral nature of the really, really important modern cements.  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement#Chemistry  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement#Setting_and_hardening  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozzolanic_reaction"

The ice chemistry -- in particular the ratios of stable isotopes of oxygen or hydrogen -- is well correlated to the air temperature at the time the snow fell.  The data that NASA plotted on that page of the reading are from Jouzel et al., 2007, which you should be able to get [here][1]. But probably a better source for understanding how these ""thermometers"" work is an earlier paper by Jouzel et al., from 1997, which you should be able to get [here][2]. This figure (Figure 1 from the 1997 paper) shows the basic idea:![Jouzel Fig 1][3]The [Greek d]18O is a measure of the ratio of 18O/16O in the H2O that makes up the ice.  Without going into the details of that measure, a more negative number (on the right hand vertical axis) means that there's more of the ""light"" 16O, and ""more negative"" correlates with colder air temperatures.  You can think about this somewhat intuitively: a water molecule that has a ""heavy"" 18O for its oxygen atom is a little bit heavier than a water molecule that has a ""light"" 16O for its oxygen atom. The slightly heavier water molecules in the atmosphere have a greater probability of condensing than the slightly lighter water molecules. If we compare warmer air temperatures to colder air temperatures, the ""heavy"" molecules have a better probability of being present as vapor in warmer air temperatures (they have enough energy to remain as vapor) than in cold air temperatures.  In cold air temperatures, the heavier water molecules will condense and precipitate out as rain or snow.  As a thought experiment, you could imagine a situation in which air temperature decreases over time.  As the temperature drops, more of the water vapor in the air condenses and potentially falls as snow.  The heavy molecules are more likely to condense out first when the air temperatures are warmer. By the time the temperature is quite cold, there are fewer ""heavy"" water molecules available, so the snow that falls at colder temperatures has ""lighter"" oxygen isotopes than the snow that falls at warmer temperatures.  This is just one way to potentially reason about this relationship.   The left-hand vertical scale is for [Greek d]D, in which the ""D"" is for deuterium.  The same argument applies, but in the dD case, they're measuring the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium (which is hydrogen with one extra neutron = ""heavier"" than the common form of hydrogen)The figure shows that there's a pretty good relationship between the annual average local surface temperature and the isotopic chemistry of the water molecules in the ice.  When air temperatures are colder, the isotopes in the H2O that makes up the ice are ""lighter"".  There are complications with distance from the water vapor source (the ocean) and with the ""history"" of the water vapor in the atmosphere where it's snowing, but the relationship shown in the figure above is the fundamental basis of using ice chemistry to estimate temperature in the past.People also estimate past temperatures by sending actual thermometers down boreholes and modeling what the surface temperature of the ice sheet would have been like in the past, knowing the physical properties of ice and rates of heat transfer.  Richard Alley has a wonderful analogy to a cook who keeps transferring a roast between the freezer and oven.  He describes it on [this page][4] - search for ""roast"".  This technique, however, gives only quite low resolution data (a smoothed curve over time).  The stable isotope measurements yield a higher-resolution data, showing variability at shorter time scales.  Others, there's more to add - please contribute useful resources!Sara  [1]: http://epic.awi.de/16356/1/Fis2007b.pdf  [2]: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Georg_Hoffmann2/publication/4661073_Validity_of_the_Temperature_Reconstruction_from_Water_Isotopes_in_Ice_Cores/links/00b49515d77c4bb21c000000.pdf  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14544494689365414.jpg  [4]: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology_IceCores/"

Let me give you some counter-points. America has not only been the funding leader, but also the leaders in the science. We were the first to systematically study the effects of CO2 in 1965 as a greenhouse gas. The Irishman Tyndall contributed, as did the Swedish chemist Arrhenius early on.I have several points. (1) China has the second largest GDP in the world, and the largest population, and yet in contributes 0.3% of what the U.S. does. On top of that it is the largest carbon polluter. Many countries have never contributed. Greece has contributed once in 18 years. The Philippines have contributed 8000 francs - which is about 1,300 USD. That is clear indication that they just don't put their money where their mouth is. I could write a 1,300 USD check - and I don't have the income of the Philippines.(2) Environmental concern is a function of wealth. If you live in any number of countries and your primary concern is feeding your family and providing it with basic health services, your carbon footprint is the least of your worries. As countries become more affluent, they will use more energy. China again is a case in point. As more people have the means to buy cars, larger houses, etc. they will pollute. All countries will follow this path. As rude as this sounds, if you want to prolong the inevitable climb in ppm CO2, keep the lesser developed countries less developed for as long as possible.(3) If the world wants to tax the rich guy, then the U.S. will need to see a real commitment from everyone. And not contributing 17 out of 18 years does not show commitment. If you want tens of billions of our tax dollars redistributed across the globe per year, then we need to see how serious you are about the problem. Our current president is very liberal - but we may very well get a republican in office next - and the likelihood of that money being transferred lessens greatly.Again, this is a political problem as much as a scientific one. And convincing the American public that this is in our best interest is going to take some work. And that starts with countries spending more on the IPCC dues than someone would spend on a fancy dinner out."

Yes. Not as much per capita as the developed nations since their per capita income is much lower. But there are a lot of Chinese and they are no longer in deep poverty. And at a certain level of very low income as in some quite poor countries then the contribution should be zero. Because our greater wealth in the West was produced significantly from the past emissions that powered the creation of our prosperity. Shouldn't part of what we pay be based on the cost we impose on others because of what we have done in the past?Yes environmental concern is a function of wealth. And environmental threat is also a partial function of wealth. Although all environmental threats may impact on all of us, the geographical reality is that some counties will be impacted more than others. The issue is when 'concern' becomes disconnected from actual threat. In an ideal world - wake me up when you discover that - concern,our emotional reaction, would be closely aligned with threat, the objective judgement of what is happening in the real world.So those who, rightly, need to focus on the day-to-day exigencies might well be hoping that others, who have the resources, mental and emotional reserves, financial capital, focus etc. can actually can deal with the 'other shit' that they can't. In the simplest terms, that those who are wealthy - in the very broadest sense of that term - should do what those who are not wealthy can't."" And convincing the American public that this is in our best interest is going to take some work""  - maybe **their** 'self interest', along with yours and mine, is actually what is in **our** self-interest."

White House, Congress and the state houses. Then they need to put in place the impartial processes for setting electoral boundaries that seriously reduce the capacity for gerrymanders.The Republicans need to feel the pain of a deep, deep rejection. Only then will they do the root and branch stock-take of the Republican party to clean out the Tea Party, hard Neo-Liberal elements. To take the GOP back to what it was, something that say Eisenhower would have recognised and loved. A real party of the Centre Right again. Currently the Republicans have a hard core Far-Right supporter base who have taken control. And a much larger traditional conservative base, not extremist, that are wondering what the hell happened to their party. Think of all those African-American/Latino conservatives who probably will never vote for this version of the Republicans.America seems to be going through one of its phases of flirting with extreme views. Maybe many Americans are hurting from many turmoils and upheavals - the GFC, the hollowing out of middle class jobs etc. But the reaction of finding others to blame just doesn't work. If times are tough, its their fault. Because they didn't foresee, adapt, evolve and grow. Americans can be fond of proclaiming how they are the greatest. To us foreigners that sort of braggadocio is really grating and jarring.  But if America wants to be great, they have to walk the walk. Talk isn't worth diddly-squat. Will all this happen? I dunno. But if the trend continues and Trump gets the nomination, then America faces two paths. You elect Bozo the Clown and he goes to war with the Supreme Court for 4 years because most of what he wants to do is unconstitutional and America implodes. Or he crashes and burns, America goes on, but the Republican party implodes, crashes and burns with him and hopefully a more grown up Republican Party mark 2 emerges from the ashes.You say Americans have a distrust of big government. That is valid up to a point. The problem is, do they have the same degree of distrust in other big things, big business etc. When a society has multiple power centres it needs to find ways to restrain all of them so that no one can become dominant. Tyranny doesn't just come from Governments. When your constitution was being framed, there was no Internet, no TV, no radio, no electricity, no telephone, no telegraph, no railways. And no vast corporations that have as much power as governments. Does your constitution need a complete review, to bring it up to date for running a 21st century nation?"

Yes I have read your post and I  thought it was most excellent.  My take away of your explanation of the Nimbus 3 / Weather balloon experiment was that the Blackbody Spectrum curve that was calculated from the weather balloon data using the properties of the GH gases was very similar.   I however was  wondering if the Wein's Law/ temperature calculation was used to determine  satellite derived global surface temperatures and, if so,  how  accurate are they (compared to actual surface readings)?    P.S.  I  was wrong about what I thought Wiki said about the Wein's Law not accounting for the greenhouse gas effect.  However a different Wiki article on the Weins  temperature calculation that got me wondering  did say  ""The equation does accurately describe the short wavelength (high frequency) spectrum of thermal emission from objects, but it fails to accurately fit the experimental data for long wavelengths (low frequency) emission."" "

Essentially it has terms describing the light passing into a parcel of gas, passing through it without being absorbed, passing through it but being scattered to a different direction, being absorbed by that parcel, and new radiation being emitted from within the parcel. So like an accounting exercise it is keeping track of everything that happens to light in that parcel. And this applies at a single wavelength.Then this process needs to be repeated for every other wavelength. Then this process needs to be repeated for every parcel of air in the air column. A giant accounting exercise. The programs that are used to do this are called Radiative Transfer Codes. Using these calculations they can calculate what spectrum we would expect to see, looking up or down from any height. In the case of Nimbus 3, high up in orbit.And in turn the instrument on the satellite measures the strength of the infrared radiation being received at the satellite, wavelength by wavelength. So it isn't using Wiens Law.What it 'sees' is the sum total of all the processes at work in the atmosphere.Wrt Wiens law not quite working, Wien was an early attempt to understand the physics of emission based on temperature. But it wasn't right. It failed at long wavelengths - essentially the far infrared, beyond the range we are considering here. There was another attempt made by Lord Raleigh and James Jeans - the Rayleigh/Jeans law. It also wasn't right, it got things wrong in the ultra-violet region - Google the Utlta-Violet Catastophe. Both were good attempts, but it needed some extra science. Several years later Max Planck cracked it. He added an extra condition to the physics, that energy had to come in discrete sized chunks and adding this in solved the problem - thus the Planck Law is the basic understanding. And in the process he laid the foundations for Quantum Mechanics that has transformed our understanding of everything.So Wiens approximation is just that, an approximation, because it doesn't get all the physics right. However, it is a useful assumption, good enough for many purposes as long as we aren't dealing with very long wavelengths. And when we look at radiation from a gas, the spectrum produced only comes from those wavelengths that the GH gases are active in. However, in that part of the spectrum the radiation will match what the Planck curve looks like for the temperature the gas is at for that part of the spectrum. So part of the Planck curve.If we had gases active across most of the spectrum they would produce something close to the Planck curve, if they are all at the same temperarure. However, the different parts of the spectrum observed by the satellite are coming from very different heights in the atmosphere, at very different temperatures. We are seeing fragments of different Planck curves, for different temperatures, overlaid over each other.Wien's Law, the Stefan Boltzmann eqn, even Plancks Law are useful as aids in understanding what is going on. But the detailed analysis has to drill down to a level of detail below that to get it right - that is what the Radiative Transfer Codes do."

Tucson is hot, and warm air can hold substantially more water vapor. This is why you can see your breath on a cold day, but not when you exhale in Tucson. I'm sure Seattle has tremendous moisture in the air due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, adding to its daily moisture content. Never been there, but it looks like it is in a low spot in comparison to some of the foothills nearby. As air is driven up over the mountains, clouds form on the windward side. Wind blows from west to east in these latitudes. Clouds would form more readily as a result. If these were the Rockies, it would snow there. Since the moisture comes out of the cloud at that point, the leeward side of the mountain range ends to be comparably arid. So I'm thinking you're talking about temperatures, proximity to an ocean, and topography.Gases tend to diffuse freely. As long as there isn't a temperature inversion in the troposphere, which would trap the smog and particulate matter where it is, CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and the other gases will move west to east also, and will rise typically, since warm air is less dense than cold air. In the troposphere, the ""lapse rate"" describes the degree to which it gets colder as you go up in altitude. More than you wanted to know likely. Cheers"

Water vapor has a short lifetime in the atmosphere (average residence time of a water molecule is on the order of 10-14 days or so), so it evaporates into and precipitates out of the atmosphere quickly and doesn't have a chance to become well-mixed like CO2.  The proportions of water vapor in the atmosphere range from about 0-5% (a large range compared to the range for CO2) of the atmospheric molecules, depending on where you are (high in the tropics, low in the dry subtropics, high in Vancouver, low over Antarctica...) - .I love those visualizations of CO2 - like the link you posted - that have come out in the past year or so!

There are many consequences beyond this.Even so  this process is more complicated than that, so you can search more information about this.There are very interesting pages about this topic, like:http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3FI hope you can understand me, I must improve my english jeje . Nadia"

The extra hydrogen ion raises the pH slightly.Bicarbonate ions in turn can break down to produce a carbonate ion and a hydrogen ion - more change of pH.Carbonate ions can combine with Calcium ions in the water to produce calcium carbonate, a mineral such as limestone.As with anything in chemistry each of these reactions are reversible. So their is a balance of the amount of CO2, Carbonic Acid, Bicarbonate and Carbonate in the sea water. As pH rises this balance shifts towards less Carbonate.When the balance has shifted enough then limestone may not form, in fact it starts to dissolve.So in the deep abyssal ocean, which is more acidic, the rocks are dark - there are no carbonate type rocks because they can't form. The danger that acidification poses is that many marine creatures also use calcium carbonate to form their shells. So as CO2 is added, their ability to create shells is impaired. For a filter feeding organism for example, shells are life and death. In contrast the actual change in acidity while it might cause some issues, is the lesser issue. It is the chemistry of carbonate that matters.And several reasons scientists are concerned about this are:a. They understand the chemistryb. They are starting to see these effects in some species already.c. The geological record has multiple instances from the past where acidification events have occurred. We have fossils showing the damage. The one on the left is from a healthy period, on the right from an acidification event.![enter image description here][1]   [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1452723631225898.png"

These are the giant companies that insure the insurers They are well aware that climate change can potentially impose significantly higher costs.Another impact on all businesses, large and small, at least in hot climates, is worker productivity. When it is hotter we need to take more rest breaks, we are physically less productive. Sure, if you are in a white collar job in a reasonably developed country you most likely have air conditioning. Not so easy to air-condition huge factories.I have done work for car companies in Australia in the past. Built into their standard operating practices is that on days above a certain temperature the production line workers take a 10 minute 'heat relief' break every hour. If temperatures rose higher that might need to be increased. Lost production.Unexpected impacts. Rail track has gaps between the rails designed to allow for thermal expansion - that is where the clicketty-clack comes from. If temperatures get too high then these gaps may not be enough and tracks buckle - and rail services are stopped. We had that last summer in Melbourne. If you try to expand the size of the gaps to get a safety margin then when the weather is colder in winter wear and tear on the wheels of the rolling stock could increase.All sorts of aspects of our infrastructure have been designed around what climate at a location has been in the past. Changing climate can require upgrades to all sorts of unexpected things. Anti-microbial dosage rates needed in water treatment plants could increase as water temperatures and thus microbe reproduction rates increase. These changes may not be huge although some might be. But potentially they can be surprisingly wide-spread.A big one - sewer and storm water systems in coastal cities are often designed around current sea levels. Beyond certain levels you may need significant redesign, lots of extra pumps etc. Florida is a current example. In some counties in southern Florida, at particularly high tides sea water is already backing up into the storm water system and leaving roads underwater.This is seawater!![enter image description here][1]  [1]: https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/7/11/1405092676110/Miami-flooding-011.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=19e724579a3fcd596387b78f781b6c6d"

Most cities and towns depend on real estate taxes to pay their bills. With most valuable real estate near the ocean, the tax base of many oceanside cities and towns could be significantly impacted in the next 50-100 years. Given that most municipalities do not run large surpluses, losing just a small % of high value real estate could pose a major budget challenge, especially if the municipalities are forced to spend more money on adaptation at the same time (our infrastructure in US cannot even cope with demands pre-CC impacts!). The New Yorker article hints at these issues; the dependence on real estate taxes in cities like Miami is the reason why government employees there are not allowed to talk about climate change.  [1]: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/12/21/the-siege-of-miami"

Essentially there is a balance between the amount of a gas present in the air above the water vs dissolved in the water. So if you add more of that gas to the air from somewhere else, some of that then dissolves in the water to reestablish the balance. But what this balance point is is also dependent on temperature - when the water is warmer the balance is towards less in the water, more in the air.If you pour a glass of cold water from the tap and leave it to warm to room temperature you will often find bubbles form on the side of the glass. That is some of the air - not just the CO2 - that was dissolved in the water that has now been forced out of solution as the water warmed.So if you add CO2 to the air and don't change the temperature then some of the extra CO2 goes into the ocean. If you don't change the amount of CO2 but warmed the ocean some of the CO2 will leave the water.If you do both, add CO2 to the air and warm the ocean, then you have a race between two opposite factors to see which dominates.  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law"

Trout on the other hand need more ppm of oxygen to live - so they tend to live in colder streams. The fact that the water is also moving allows more oxygen to be dissolved into the mix as well.

Others have also made estimates of the planetary imbalance, for example, [Hansen et al, 2011][2], who estimate an imbalance of about +0.58 +/- 0.15 W/m2.  Hansen et al were using a different time period and different data than Trenberth et al., but both arrive at a small imbalance with more energy coming in than leaving in recent years.  You might be interested in Hansen's paper, as they go on to discuss the implications of this small imbalance persisting over time, in particular the impacts on land ice melt and sea level.  Regarding the exercise to examine the balance for the atmosphere using Trenberth's diagram, you'll get a little imbalance for the atmosphere too if you do that.  The point of that note below the video was that the values for the fluxes Trenberth depicts within the system (below the top of the atmosphere) are less well constrained, so I wouldn't recommend drawing conclusions from the exercise to compare the fluxes in and out of the atmosphere.  Trenberth goes into quite a bit of detail regarding how they chose the numbers they chose for that diagram, so you might want to consult that paper.The bottom line (I think) is that there's a planetary imbalance with more energy coming in than leaving.  The imbalance will persist until the planet heats enough to emit an amount of energy to space that balances what's coming in. We perpetuate the imbalance longer by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.  What are your thoughts on implications?  Sara  p.s.

Air has warmed, ice has melted, the ground has actually warmed a little. All of this requires extra heat from somewhere. But the primary location where heat is accumulating is the oceans. Over 90% of the extra heat being measured from around the world is going into the oceans.[This website][1] from NOAA shows the build-up of heat in the ocean. It is an animation. Click on box 2 to hold it on the one diagram. That is extra heat being added to the ocean down to a depth of 2000 meters. When we work it out - you can do the math roughly just from eyeballing the graph -  heat build up in recent years has been at a rate of over 300 trillion watts.In contrast total human energy consumption - which ends up being added to the environment as waste heat - is around 18 trillion watts. And the largest heat source here on Earth is geothermal heat. Geologists have estimated this at around 44-47 trillion watts. So the observed heat buildup in the oceans is too large to be originating from any source here on earth. Leaving only one physically possible answer. The earth is currently in an energy imbalance with external energy flows.Also, if we divide that rate of buildup by the earths surface area - 510 trillion m^2 - to get a rate per m^2 we get a figure of around 0.6 watts/m^2. In the same ball-park as the figures from Hansen Sara mentioned.I have written several articles about this in the past at SkepticalScience, you might find them interesting - [here][2], [here][3], and [here][4].

The quantity ë± is the Earth‰Ûªs albedo.  It is shown that relatively modest changes of only a few percent in ë±, brought about by variations in cloudiness, are sufficient to account for the observed 20th Century variations in Earth‰Ûªs measured temperature, provided that such variations in cloudiness can cause an imbalance in the ratio ( 1 - ë±) / ëµ.  The analysis suggests that in the long run, the absorptivity to emissivity ratio is near unity, as required by Kirchhoff‰Ûªs radiation law, which ensures a moderate average temperature of about 5.7 C for the Earth‰Ûªs surface entities.""Emissivity and absorptivity are wavelength specific. A material can have differing emissivities at different wavelengths. And [Kirchoffs Law][1] is also wavelength specific. KL also requires thermal equilibrium and the entire varied surface of the planet is not at thermal equilibrium. Next using the Earths entire albedo is meaningless, that is a composite of many differing materials with differing albedo's.Albedo (and thus absorptivity) is what is applicable in the visible and near infrared wavelengths because it the frequency range of the incoming sunlight. And albedo at these wavelengths for different materials varies enormously. Fresh snow might reflect nearly 90% of light. Water, for light anywhere near vertical incidence, only reflects around 10% of light. Rock, soils, vegetation etc absorb 60-80%, deserts 60% or so.In contrast, for emissions in the infrared for most natural materials emissivity is very high - 95-99%, with an average around 97%. The equilibrium temperature is actually much lower, more like -18C precisely because the earth's absorptivity - 1 - ë± - in the visible is significantly lower than it's emissivity in the infrared.I will read more of this later but I suspect there will be many more errors. A question.

The equivalence between e & a is only at individual wavelengths. The same material can have very different e & a values at different wavelengths. We can make an assessment of the earths overall albedo across the solar spectrum, averaged over all materials, from satellite observations. Just how much light in the solar spectrum is reflected. Then if we were dealing with an earth with no atmosphere, or at least an atmosphere that is completely transparent to infrared, we need to estimate the emissivity in the infrared range. Hertzberg assumes that e in the infrared will be similar to a in the visible. It is not. See [here][3]. Look down the tables at common materials from nature - water, rough ice, vegetation, sand, rocks. 70% of the earth's surface (350 million km^2 approx) is water and around 10 million km^2 of that is ice on average, and 11% of the land is covered by ice. Then snow cover, mainly in the northern hemisphere is typically 30 km^2 in spring, 45 km^2 in winter and 18 km^2 in autumn; average snow cover over the year is roughly (30+45+18)/4 = 23 million km^2 of the land. Water ice and snow dominate the earths infrared emissivity. And rock and vegtation doesn't alter this much. So on average 0.95 or higher.In contrast Hertzberg thinks infrared and visible wavelength emissivities are the same, thus he worked with a figure much lower.Next he uses a figure for the earths albedo from a single paper (also publised at E&E) that gave a figure of 0.367 for visible albedo. Most estimates put the figure at closer to 0.3 for visible albedo. So look at his figure 1. Follow the curve for albedo of 0.3. See where it intersects emissivity of 0.95 or higher - off the right of his graph. What height is this point on the vertical temperature axis? between -10 and -20C. Hertzberg's dismissal of this result isn't based on investigating infrared emissivity, but rather on the fact that he hasn't done so and makes a naive and wrong assumption about it.So he says:""Let us examine that argument in more detail using Fig. 1, which was obtained from Eqs. (1) and (2). As can be seen from the graph, for an average albedo of 0.367 (which equates with an absorptivity of 0.633) the only way one can obtain sub-zero temperatures as low as -20 to -25oC, is to have an almost perfectly emissive Earth (emissivity near unity). Such a unit emissivity assumption, however, directly contradicts the use of an albedo of 0.367. Since most of the albedo is caused by cloud cover, it is impossible for Earth to radiate out into Space with unit emissivity if 37% of that radiation is reflected back to Earth, or absorbed by the bottom of those same clouds. Even for those portions of Earth that are not covered with clouds, the assumption that the ocean surface, land surfaces, or ice and snow cover would all have blackbody emissivities of unity, is unreasonable.""So if we substitute albedo 0f 0.3 rather than 0.367 then we no longer need emissivity of unity, we only need emissivity close to 1. So rephrasing his words ""Such a near-unit emissivity assumption, however, directly contradicts the use of an albedo of 0.367""No it doesn't. Because albedo in the visible range isn't correlated to emissivity in the infrared. In fact emissivities of near 1 are actually the observed properties of natural materials. The water droplets in those clouds - IR emissivity of 0.96 thus albedo of 0.04. Ice and snowflakes in clouds - IR emissivity of 0.99 so albedo of 0.01.Hertzbergs paper is simply an argument from ignorance. If he had made the most basic checks he would have seen the fallacy in his argument.   [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation#Theory  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation#Factors_influencing_the_rate_of_evaporation  [3]: https://books.google.com.au/books?id=z_anVNTmQLUC&pg=PA56&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false"

I have not seen anybody claim that going vegan is going to SOLVE the climate problem. The important point that Cowspiracy makes is that leading environmental organizations have failed to address the role of diet in reducing GHG emissions. If those organizations are telling people to drive less or choose more fuel efficient cars, for example, it is a fair question to ask as to why they aren't asking people to switch to more plant-based diets. As Nuccitelli explains, meat production is also very wasteful in terms of land and water use."

If atmospheric CO2 goes up when inflows exceed outflows and down when outflows exceed inflows, why the peaks occur in spring and the valleys in fall? Maybe I've got the wrong concept but I thought that photosynthesis happens during the spring...which means that plants need CO2 and take it from the atmosphere, therefore higher outflow. And during fall most plants decay and release CO2 to the atmosphere (higher inflow). That is why I thought peaks are in fall and valleys in spring.Could anyone help me with this?

Then, if you graph the CO2 stock, the peak occurs in spring. The same reasoning can be applied to the valleys. During all spring and summer the outflow is bigger than the inflow, and when fall came, the inflow is bigger than outflow, leading to a ""valley"" in the graph of stock of CO2 in atmosphere.(Didnt check for spelling or grammar, just a quick response, hope this clarifies your doubt)"

This is a Gish Gallop  - spew out so many points in rapid succession it is impossible to reply sensibly to them, even if they are all wrong.Next this is in effect an argument from incredulousness. Implicitly he is saying - 'There is so much complex stuff, how could we or CO2 influence that?'. Without evaluating underlying mechanisms you can't make a judgement. So, the start of his piece is a gish gallop of things not relavent to his contention except he is trying to frame it in a particular way. He is essentially trying a bit of 'and he blinded them with SCIENCE'Everything from ""Temperatures on Earth dance to a cyclic rhythm ..."" to ""This produces spring, summer, autumn and winter for every spot on Earth"" is a Gish Gallop. All of it is true, but not relavent. This is weather. But he is trying to frame it as 'Gee, there is so much other complicated stuff, CO2 can't be important'""Then there is the 22 year sun-spot cycle, which correlates with cycles of floods and droughts. Sunspot cycles are indicators of solar activity which causes periods of global warming and cooling."" Nope. There is some evidence that the solar cycle has some detectable impacts at regional levels, and perhaps in the stratosphere but not that it equates to anything global. Major shutdowns of sunspot activity for decades are correlated with some climate changes, but not on the scale of what we are doing now. He is trying to magnify the significance of the solar cycle beyond what the evidence supports.""Earth‰Ûªs climate is also disrupted periodically by the effects of changing winds, ocean hot spots and submarine volcanism that produce the El Nino Southern Oscillation""Nope. Unless winds change on timescales of multiple decades it's not a change of the climate. Similarly with the occurrence of hotspots. He is confusing climate and whether. And ENSO is **NOT** connected to submarine volcanoes! ENSO processes are associated with changes in the Walker Circulation pattern in the atmosphere, particularly the Pacific, and Kelvin Wave patterns in the surface waters across the Pacific.From ""The least recognised but most dangerous climate cycle is the glacial cycle. ... "" to ""These drive variations in solar energy received by Earth and have the greatest temperature effect on the large land masses of the Northern Hemisphere."" are essentially true. But again, they are part of his 'Gee isn't stuff complex' theme.""On an even longer time scale, oscillation of the solar system through the plane of the Galaxy seems to trigger magnetic reversals and violent spasms of volcanism, crustal movements glaciation and species extinction. Earth is never still for long.""This is fringe science. Possibly our passage through the galactic plane may change how much dust is in the solar system and impact on sunlight reaching the earth somewhat. The rest is not respected in mainstream science. And these processes, as causal agents, are way outside his expertise as a geologist. So how does he justify ""seems to""?""First, ice cores show that in the glacial spring-time the temperature rose BEFORE the CO2 levels rose. Therefore the rising CO2 cannot be a CAUSE of the warming ‰ÛÒ it is a RESULT of CO2 being expelled from the warming oceans"".This is called a non-sequitur and is setting up a false dichotomy. Literally 'it does not follow'. His logical fallacy is that something must be either a cause or a consequence, when in fact it can be both.If you can start a fire by lighting some kerosene, then add cardboard to make it burn better, does it not follow that you can start a fire by lighting some cardboard then add some kerosene to make it burn better. He is in effect arguing that because the kerosene was ignited first, cardboard can't start fires?When the reality of what is expected over a glacial warming is: Orbital changes produce a small reduction in northern hemisphere snow and ice cover. This has a warming effect. Then feedbacks amplify this. More snow and ice retreat and more warming. Warming oceans produces outgassing of CO2 which causes more warming. Increased methane release from melting permafrost and increased wetlands produces more warming from Methane. And so on....And he is wrong in fact anyway. CO2 lags ice-cores in one hemisphere, it is in synch with temperatures in the other. Most likely changes in ocean currents between the northern and southern hemispheres resulted in a greater warming trend in the southern hemisphere and less warming in the north.""Second, at the top of every summer-time in the glacial cycle, the high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere were unable to prevent the cooling into the next cycle of ice.""Now his logic is faulty. Previously he was expecting a change in CO2 to cause a change. Now he expects a static level of CO2 to prevent a change. When in fact, if other influences such as orbital cycles are considered they are introducing a cooling trend. CO2 can't 'prevent' that trend unless CO2 levels actually rose to counteract it. When in fact CO2 levels would be expected to fall under a cooling trend, amplifying the cooling. When some other factor alters temperature, CO2 changes due to oceanic outgassing/uptake will amplify that change. In contrast, if some other factor, not temperature related, changes CO2 levels, that will change the temperature. Like a modestly intelligent apeman digging up fossil carbon and burning it.""We are already in the autumn of the current glacial cycle and nothing man can do will change that. Global temperatures today are lower than they were in Roman and Medieval times."" Nope. Compared to the medieval period, that is an open question - it looks like that was a period of unstable climate. Compared to the Roman period, Temps today may be as high as back then, but that isn't what should be happening! As he says, we are in the early stages of a descent into the next ice cycle. We should be cooler than previously! That we are not, and getting warmer is contrary to what should be happening at this phase in a glacial cycle. We already are cancelling that cooling!""...temperatures will continue drifting downwards""But they aren't. Because CO2 is warmng the planet faster than the trend towards a glacial is cooling it. We are winning that race.""The transition from Greenhouse Earth to Icehouse Earth always occurs suddenly""Nope. The transition from warm to cold is always slower and far more erratic. It is the warming from cold to warm that happens much quicker - that's in the ice cores he talks about. And the orbital cycles that drive this change will only produce a very slow cooling for the next 50,000 years in this cycle - each cycle is different.""Frost, snow, hail and ice are the killers.""And so are heatwaves. Food doesn't grow if it it too cold. And it doesn't grow if it is too hot. If it is cold we can rug up, light fires etc. If our descendants lack the capacity to build modern air-conditioners, there is no defense against extreme heat. If you can't cool your body enough in a hot and most particularly humid environment you die. Look at the deaths in India last summer.""humans may follow our Neanderthal cousins who perished in the last glacial winter, just 20,000 years ago.""Nope. Neanderthals survived more than one full glacial just fine. What did them in was meeting Homo Sapiens.""It is a wonder of the modern era that people who cannot accurately forecast next weekend‰Ûªs weather claim they can regulate the temperature of the whole globe"" He really doesn't know the difference between weather and climate does he?An analogy. I have a swimming pool. The water level is low so I toss the garden hose in and turn it on to fill it up. Big pool, small hose, it's going to take a while. In the mean time my family are using the pool - making waves, doing 'bombs', tossing a frisbee into the pool so the dog can leap in after it. Can I predict what the pattern of waves on the pool will be like 5 minutes from now? Nope, too complex. By his argument, therefore I can't predict whether the pool will fill up!""There is NO evidence in climate history that carbon dioxide has a detectable effect on global temperatures.""Nope.Firstly, read my post about observing the role of CO2 in the greenhouse effect [here][1]:Next, topics to Google. - Faint Young Sun Problem - He didn't mention an important aspect of the deep past. The Sun. It wasn't as warm long ago. The Sun's output has risen by around 40% over the life of the Earth. And a very, very strong GH Effect was an important part of how the earth was habitable when the Sun was weaker.- Large Igneous Provinces. Vast volcanic events that contributed to Mass Extinctions by releasing huge amounts of CO2 and other things - funny omission for a geologist.- The Ordovician Mass extinction when CO2 levels fell and triggered an ice age.- Snowball Earth events, when declines in the GH Effect left the Earth nearly completely covered in ice and it took a subsequent huge buildup of CO2 into a massive GH Effect to get it back out of the snowball- The End Permian Mass Extinction and volcanism from the Siberian Traps - huge warming with sea surface temperatures at the equator as high as 40 C.- The End-Triassic Mass Extinction when volcanism triggered by the breakup of Pangaia (creating the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province or CAMP)- Recent research by Burgess and Bowring dating the timing of the extinction of the dinosaurs at 150,000 years after the impact of the asteroid. But around the peak eruption period for an LIP in India - the Deccan Traps.- The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 55 million years ago - Sara referenced this. A spike in CO2, a spike in temperatures, an ocean acidification event and a smaller mass extinction.- The CO2 history of the last 65 million years and contrasting that with the temperature record.That's enough :-)  [1]: http://:https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+Climate1x+1T2016/discussion/forum/7ed62763a96972a9c5969d1ab8c70657ae6a644b/threads/56a6122ba66778052d000db4"

[Photosynthesis][1] is pretty damn complex, a intricate sequence of reactions. And 13CO2 just disrupts the reactions a bit compared to 12CO2, enough to not be taken up as well.This also varies between photosynthesis mechanisms. What is known as C3 photosynthesis is more vulnerable to this 13C issue. C3 photosynthesis is the much older mechanism, evolutionarily speaking, and most plants on earth us C3. Another mechanism, C4 is a more recent evolutionary adaptation. It is a more complex process and it copes with the inefficiencies of C3, allowing better productivity. And as a side-effect it doesn't suffer from the 13C issue. It is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation to declining CO2 levels over geological timescales. But only  limited number of species use it, mainly some grasses. ""Forty-six percent of grasses are C4 and together account for 61% of C4 species. These include the food crops maize, sugar cane, millet, and sorghum"". But not wheat and rice.  There is actually a research program to try and transplant the C4 mechanism into rice which is currently C3  - a huge task. This isn't moving one gene, it needs and entire gene complex.There is a 3rd photosynthesis mechanism - CAM. I don't know much about that one.  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"

Chapter 3 has some information about why a plant treats the two isotopes differently.Partly the difference comes from the fact that the heavier isotope moves slower, the difference between C3 and C4 plants seems to be that C3 uses $CO_2$ as the first step in reaction wheras C4 starts out using $HCO_{3}{^{-}}$ "

I feel confident that as you read it, in the context of the question above, your understanding will be different from mine. Does it mean 'must' be involved? Does it mean prioritising scientific advice? Does it mean actually being decision makers? And whose 'science' are we talking about?I 'should' of course take more exercise, and eat healthier food, and drink less alcohol. As humans in society we 'should' be more compassionate, more tolerant, more open-minded, and less constrained by our cultural heritage. Scientists as a group would no doubt feel that they 'should' be heard by decision takers, but so would those for whom religion is important, those who are disadvantaged by poverty, or gender, or skin colour. Decision making is a political activity and politicians are notoriously unwilling to look beyond their medium term self-interest. In fact, to be honest, so are we all. And do the public in fact want decision making to be driven by science? A recent IPSOS/Mori poll (https://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Infographics/pas-2014-summary-infographic.pdf) suggests that only 55% of those surveyed felt that the benefits of science outweighed any harmful effects. Only 45% felt well informed about science. These findings in an 'advanced' western society, so what price elsewhere?There is evidence that scientific opinion is heard and understood by politicians, but action is a different matter; procrastination is a more likely outcome unless there is an immediate crisis, with potentially disadvantageous consequences, to be resolved. It seems to me that the best scientists as a whole can expect is that they will be heard as one voice amongst many competing for attention. It is important though to keep shouting or else those many for whom rationality is an unfamiliar concept may win the day."

I do belief that part of that barrier has to do with finding appropriate ways to reach the uninformed public.

For instance, science was able to explain the impacts of global warming such as frequent heat waves, floods and even diseases. Therefore, by revealing to societies the seriousness of the situation and the damage they will encounter, science will affect decisions made by societies and urge them to behave in a green and sustainable way so as to reduce the chance of getting exposed to such disastrous consequences. - Science finally guides communities and governments by proposing the most efficient, sustainable and cost effective solutions to the problem before it is too late. For example, as a way to show their will for a prosperous future, some governments have implemented solar energy projects or wind farms to generate a substantial portion of their electricity from renewable sources. "

However, of great importance, along with science, especially in understanding behaviours, modeling, and observations of shifting paradigms and ideas, such as clouds, is the assurance that the science is proven and the findings true. Modeling can be shifted to meet the hypothesis of the investigator, so the science used must be tested, relevant, and true. Moreover, a great awareness of qualitative information and data has been incorporated in science as the need for social perception, emotion, and qualitative qualities needs to be considered within decision-making. For example, in reviewing a pipeline application, the proponent needs to base their information on peer reviewed science that forms a factual basis for analysis, within that review, decision-makers also need to review that application in two parts - the science basis of quantitative studies, probabilities, normal distribution, outliers, and so forth, and qualitative studies of public perception, impacts on social well-being, cultural health, and economic well being. The qualitative analysis of personal health and safety is not irrational, it is a very true and very real scientific discussion, it is in fact a psychological and medical review of determinants of health and well-being. All in all, the role of science in all domains and aspects plays a critical role in decision-making and analysis. Climate science needs to include the qualitative aspect of impacts to the community socially, culturally, and economically, to be a holistic perspective of its impacts and to allow for a more adequate role of decision-making.

A carbon tax will harm many industries, and will probably result in a net job loss in those countries responsible for paying it. That is a tough sell for any politician.

It has also given room for a few political to selectively choose the few scientific papers which deny climate change and use that as evidence. This appears to be generally the case the US congress.

The focus on CO2 particular is evidence based, on the known properties of different substances.""We need more oxygen. Therefore, we need trees and plants and forests. We must reforest the planet, otherwise the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere will continue decreasing.""Yes but. Reforestation is needed but the decline in oxygen levels, though real, is by a very tiny amount. The world is not in danger of oxygen starvation.""In addition to the above, I also wonder why  other, far more critical causes of climate change like nuclear power (for both peaceful and warfare purposes), and also electromagnetic and chemical intervention are not even mentioned, let alone addressed.""Because these are not more critical causes of **climate change**. While there are other concerns around these issues, they are quite minor contributors to climate change. To put some numbers to this. The Greenhouse Effect, of which CO2 is an important part, modulates the flow of energy that arrives from the sun back out to space. And this energy flow is enormous. Something like 6700 times the size of all human energy consumption, 2700 times greater than all the geothermal heat flowing from within the earth. The Earth is around 33 Deg C warmer than it otherwise would be because of the GH Effect. It is the most powerful force on the planet.""Does not peaceful nuclear power production and the resultant nuclear accidents (Chernobyl and Fukusima to name just two of many such accidents) change the climate? And what about further radiation leakage caused by nuclear tests  and warfare?Does not the practice of large-scale chemical spraying change the climate?Does not the electromagnetic intervention in the ionosphere with HAARP, the testing of its various applications, and its actual implementation change the climate?""At anything more than the most insignificant level, no. ""Finally, do you think that the fact that an international treaty has been signed on climate change, with the intent to minimize the emissions of carbon dioxide only by imposing a ‰ÛÏcarbon tax‰Ûù, and this treaty‰Ûªs concomitant legalized trade of carbon dioxide emissions, really address the problem?""No, they are inadequate, but at least a start."

Adding or removing energy from the system. That is ultimately what climate change is, a change in the energy content of the climate system. And you are referring to Nuclear **accidents**. Although  a nuclear accident does release radioactive material with other possible health and environmental impacts, it is the climate impacts that you are asking about.Let me use a nuclear metaphor - not accidents but actual nuclear explosions!. Heat content in the oceans is currently rising at a rate of between 300 to 320 trilllion watts. That is the equivalent to the energy release from the detonation of around 5 Hiroshima bombs **per second**!.The rate at which energy arrives from the Sun every second and is in turn radiated out to space is around 121,000 trillion watts; nearly 2000 Hiroshima bombs per second.The scale of energy involved in the climate system is so vastly much more than the energy involved in nuclear accidents that those accidents can't even register as a blip.However, if an accident triggered another impact, that might conceivably have a climate impact. For example, if an accident caused very large scale destruction of forests, the change in the reflectivity of the earth this could cause might have a climate impact. But the accidents to date have not had anything like this impact.Even if a full scale nuclear war occurred, with massive loss of life and huge other **environmental** impacts, the **climate** impact of that would largely be due to the cooling effect of all the smoke from fires, and the change in reflectivity for those ex-forested regions after the smoke has settled.I am not saying their aren't other important issues like questions over nuclear but the climate system is just so much, much larger that only certain types of factors can impact it. As another example, you mentioned HAARP. The HAARP system at full output directs a 3.6 Megawatt signal into the ionophsphere. In contrast heat from the sun is 121,000 trillion watts - 33 billion times more powerful.Climate is all about energy. "

One should always be wary of 'single-study syndrome'. The Union of Concerned Scientists puts the figure at 27,000. Greenpeace suggests 10,000 - 200,000 a very wide margin of estimation. So the question of what the level of risk from lower level radiation contamination is needs to be based on weighing up all the science on it.I am not claiming any particular view, but am always wary of basing anything on the views of a few people, irrespective of what that view is.Even taking the claim at face value of a million people from Chernobyl, that's 33,000 per year. With lower estimates that might be a few thousand per year.In contrast 1.2 million [people died from Aids][1] in 2014, down from 2 million in 2005.584,000 died of [Malaria][2] in 2014 with 198 million cases. 1.24 million died in [road accidents][3] in 2010.[Smoking][4] kills around 5 million people a year.[Cancers][5] of all kinds caused 8.2 million deaths in 2012.And [air pollution][6], particularly cooking indoors using coal etc cause 7 million premature deaths a year.Nuclear accidents are a concern but so far they haven't been a significant cause of mortality.

You are right! We don't really have a lot of time to educate the world. I still feel optimistic though. I see a lot of good momentum behind the climate movement. There are many young people involved. The Paris agreement was a necessary though obviously not a sufficient step in the right direction. There is more talk of climate change (some of it denial of course) among the US presidential candidates than ever before. On the solutions side, renewable energy is becoming competitive with fossil fuels. There are plans out there (check out [100.org][1]) that demonstrate that 100% renewable is doable. The US just extended the solar tax credit which will fuel more installations of roof top solar for several years to come.  I see businesses starting to realize not just that climate change is a risk but also a business opportunity. I feel like we could be close to a tipping point where we go from debating the science to seeing significant mitigation actions starting to happen both in the public and private sector and among regular people.    [1]: https://100.org"

They meet to decide on drafts and reports from the IPCC. They are paid for by the individual member governments.Then there is a Chairman, Vice Chairman etc. They are paid for by the IPCC.Next there is a support staff. Based in Geneva they provide administrative support, media liaison, websites etc. About a dozen people. They don't even have their own headquarters, they occupy a suite of offices in the World Meteorological Organisation headquarters in Geneva.Next, the scientists who compile the technical reports. All these scientists work pro-bono. Their salaries are paid by their individual academic institutions and their involvement in the IPCC process is seen as just part of their normal academic duties. Administrative costs for their involvement, travel to meetings etc is probably paid by the IPCCSupport to the scientists. Each of the Working Groups has a small support staff to assist in compiling the reports. Typically half a dozen people per working group. And the costs for each of these support groups is carried by the member governments of the lead authors, not the IPCC.[This document][1] shows the 2014 budget and proposed 2015 budget:9,750,740 Swiss Francs in 20145,162.860 Francs in 2015 - probably lower because the AR5 release cycle was winding down.So not exactly a large or expensive organisation.An important point to remember about organisations such as the UN. Although there is obviously an administrative support staff, perhaps in significant numbers, ultimately what the UN does is democratic. Member nations vote on what happens, decide to ratify (or not) proposals etcAs to the developed world (it's not just the US) contributing to help developing nations cope with climate change, if we don't address it we all suffer the consequences. This is a global problem where we can't quarantine our actions to 'we will solve the problem in our country alone'. The atmosphere doesn't respect national borders.You are right that countries will follow self interest. But self interest also means defence against problems that might arise from outside the country. We spend huge budgets on military defence against outside threats. Surely it is in a countries self-interest to guard against, say, the latitude of the major rain bands shifting, disrupting our agriculture sector, or a neighbouring state experiencing substantial social upheaval with massive refugee flows across our borders.When global factors impact our national self-interest, surely tackling the global issue is in our self-interest?  [1]: http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session37/p37_decision_budget.pdf"

The one from Judith Curry isn't very conclusive but also not really current.The first one from [CNS-news][1] raises a couple of red flags for me right at the beginning by the way they use loaded words, e.g. here (my emphasis): - ""... the United Nations‰Ûª authority on *alleged* man-made global warming..."" - Bringing up the non-scandal dubbed ""Climategate"": ""The e-mails included those between Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University and author of the *infamous* ‰ÛÏhockey stick‰Ûù graph that *apparently* showed global temperatures reaching ‰ÛÏunprecedented‰Ûù levels, and Phil Jones, director at CRU, which brought into question the validity of the IPCC‰Ûªs work, with the reported statements ‰ÛÏhide the decline,‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏMike‰Ûªs Nature Trick.‰Ûù""As you may already have guessed by now, I'm obviously biased in the direction of accepting the consensus position due to my involvement with Skeptical Science (not to mention being a co-author of Cook et al.

I found the following in an [online article][1] titled *The Skeptics vs. the Ozone Hole* (emphasis added by me):> ""On June 28, **1974**, Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina, chemists at the University of California, Irvine, published the first scientific paper warning that human-generated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could cause serious harm to Earth's protective ozone layer (Molina and Rowland, 1974). They calculated that if CFC production continued to increase at the going rate of 10%/year until 1990, then remain steady, CFCs would cause a global 5 to 7 percent ozone loss by 1995 and 30-50% loss by 2050.> They warned that the loss of ozone would significantly increase the amount of skin-damaging ultraviolet UV-B light reaching the surface, greatly increasing skin cancer and cataracts. The loss of stratospheric ozone could also significantly cool the stratosphere, potentially causing destructive climate change. Although no stratospheric ozone loss had been observed yet, CFCs should be banned, they said. At the time, the CFC industry was worth about $8 billion in the U.S., employed over 600,000 people directly, and 1.4 million people indirectly (Roan, 1989).> Critics and skeptics--primarily industry spokespeople and scientists from conservative think tanks--immediately attacked the theory. Despite the fact that Molina and Rowland's theory had wide support in the scientific community, a handful of skeptics, their voices greatly amplified by the public relations machines of powerful corporations and politicians sympathetic to them, succeeded in delaying imposition of controls on CFCs for many years. However, the stunning discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole in 1985 proved the skeptics wrong. Human-generated CFCs were indeed destroying Earth's protective ozone layer. **In fact, the ozone depletion was far worse than Molina and Roland had predicted.** No one had imagined that ozone depletions like the 50% losses being observed by 1987 over Antarctica were possible so soon. Despite the continued opposition of many of the skeptics, the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out ozone-destroying chemicals, was hurriedly approved in 1987 to address the threat.> Ozone depletion worsened globally throughout the 1990's, with peak ozone losses reaching 70% in Antarctica in Spring, 30% in the Arctic in Spring, 8% in Australia in summer, 10-15% in New Zealand in summer, and 3% globally year-round (WMO, 2002; Manin et. al., 2001; McKenzie et. al., 1999). In response, the international community adopted four amendments to the Montreal Protocol in the 1990's to promote an ever faster phase out of ozone-destroying chemicals. Finally, in the early 2000's, although the we cannot yet say that stratospheric ozone depletion has reached its maximum, atmospheric levels of ozone-destroying substances in the atmosphere are now declining, and a disappearance of the Antarctic ozone hole is expected by about 2050 (WMO, 2002). **Molina and Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1995.** The citation from the Nobel committee credited them with helping to deliver the Earth from a potential environmental disaster.> On this 30th anniversary of the beginning of the ozone depletion debate, it is revealing to review the techniques the skeptics used in the CFC-ozone depletion issue over the past 30 years. All of them have parallels in the current global warming debate.""  [1]: http://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/ozone_skeptics.asp"

I have a science background, but I am taking the course as much for political reasons as scientific. I enjoy seeing how the two forces collide. People who are adamant opponents of the idea that man might have an influence on climate tend to be very politically active. They are less driven by science than the idea that the government should not be dictating energy policy. They feel that the market should decide which direction to take. When solar is cheap and efficient, we'll choose it. Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the Whitehouse, only to be removed by Reagan. That is a snapshot of the movement right there."

On the other hand, storms with large amounts of water in small periods of time have been causing floodings in cities. The weather is warmer. Thus, there is a large proliferation of mosquitoes causing diseases such as dengue fever and zyka."

I covertly have my post-high-school / pre-university daughters taking my MOOC courses with me.  From the moment I get home from work in the afternoon until I go to sleep at night, I have the course lectures playing in the kitchen.  Like a song played regularly on the radio - even when you hate the song you somehow still learn all the words.  I am hoping that the words and messages of the lectures just seep into their brains.  Often I will play lectures 4 or 5 times over the week so they have repeated exposure.  I do find them catching something which piques their interest and they will come over and watch a lecture over my shoulder or ask a question.  We now live in the anthropocene.  There is no getting around it and we all need to be 'literate' in how we got here; why we got here and how we might survive the coming challenges to our and other species' existence."

He thinks that every scientist associated with a public university is afraid to challenge the idea that man is causing climate change, and he distrusts all data from the IPCC for that reason.

It is brilliant and will give you a solid grounding on how to approach any topic logically.  As for politics, BrentR2 is correct:  your politics determines your denial or acceptance of climate change.  Any sane person would realize that that is ridiculous.  Can you image a political debate between Republicans and Democrats on where gravity exists or not or if it is blood that carries oxygen to your brain versus the 4 humors which keep you alive?

We have had snow in mid March and April in the past. Last year, we probably had a comparably mild summer. Memphis is usually humid by July. Now, we did have some humid days during July and August....but in 2015, it seemed like the humidity didn't go into full blast until September and maybe the first week of October. Then by Halloween, the weather cooled down but we had a slightly warm Thanksgiving, but Christmas (and admittedly to my delight) was 70 degrees. Before Christmas, we had some nasty thunderstorms, while our neighbor (Mississippi) experienced tornadoes.

The lake used to be filled with water even in summertime, but now it nearly dries up in summer time. This is partly due to reduced rainfall and partly due to the fact that farmers use the lake's water for irrigation, via pumps. We also tend to have two seasons instead of four. Spring and autumn are very short. Some flowers bloom much earlier than they used to. For instance, violets bloom in February whereas in the past they bloomed in April. Trees bloom much earlier too. For instance, cherry trees. When a hail storm hits cherry blossoms most of them fall on the ground. I have no background in biology or science. I guess trees bloom earlier because of the rise in temperature, but I may be wrong. Lastly, ants and other insects which appeared only in summertime in the past, now tend to appear even in winter time when temperatures are higher than usual."

I live in Eastern Tennessee in the southern US, and when I was a kid in the 1960s we could usually count on seeing three or four good snows every winter-in the 4""-6"" depth range-that would lead to school being cancelled and loads of fun for us going out sledding, building snowmen, and generally having a blast. Nowadays, we rarely get a snow of more than an inch or two, and I had a nephew and nieces born in the 1980s who didn't see a decent snow here for years. In addition, spring-like storms are becoming more common in the winter months. Just this past December, we had thunderstorms and very destructive and deadly tornadoes in the southern US. And not long ago, I was talking to my neighbor who was marveling at a blooming shrub that she told me she had never seen bloom before February.So, in my neck of the woods, as we say here in the southern US, evidence of the warming climate is undeniable. And yet, in the United States, at least, we still have people who claim otherwise, that those who discuss and try to take action to stem global warming are part of some sort of conspiracy concocted by environmental extremists and those with liberal political views who are basically out to destroy the economic system and society of the United States.

Located right in the center of the Iberian Peninsula is the largest city of Spain. My first observation (and the most obvious for everyone living in Madrid) is a cause rather than a consequence and it is what we use to call ""the black beret/cap"", which is a great layer of pollution above the city moving accordingly to the wind. Madrid is cold but very sunny in winter so it is quite an easy observation from any high point.What I have observed in Spain (already mentioned by several peers in this thread) is mainly a rise in the temperatures and a decrease in rainfall. But as Spain is very diverse, these observations may not be suitable for every single region. We are now living through a lot of fires in mountains and forests (some of them manmade) in Northern Spain, a rainy and very green part of the territory. Warmer temperatures and lack of rainfall are likely the main causes.But beyond these observations, I have found some interesting but disturbing research about Climate Change, Impacts and Adaptation conducted by the Agricultural and Environmental Ministry. Temperature rise and rainfall decrease are already assumed as real consequences of climate change. Because I do not live in the countryside I have no personal and specific observations refered to fauna & flora, but is well known the arrival of new species that endanger the native ones. Finally, hard droughts are expected to occur in Shoutern Spain and on the islands, leading to a water supply problem."

When I went back there for holidays last July, temperatures were really warm. Even at night, outside, it was feeling canicular to me. I can't remember of such a summer in Paris and my first thought was of course that climate change was responsible for that.However, when you look at temperature timeseries around Paris, 2015 is far from being the warmest July month in the past ~70 years. For example, July 1959 was warmer by a few tens of degree, July 1983 by more than one degree.  You can find 2 year warmer in the 90's but only one in the 2000's and so on. If you look at the temperature timeserie for Paris, you can actually see a clear warming trend only if you look at more than 30 to 40 consecutive years. At shorter timescales, the serie looks very variable due to, for example, the oscillation of the El Nino oscillation or the North Atlantic oscillation, and other causes of natural variability.![enter image description here][1]So having lived for a few years in Paris, can I really relate my observations of a few warm July days to climate change? Or do I automatically attribute a warm day to climate change because I'm hearing so much about it?Climate change is of course a reality, my point here is just that because most of us haven't live at the same place for a long time (ie more than a few decades), when we observe (in weather or ecosystem) what we think is unusual, we'd better double-check with an ""elder"" or with local record!Also, the example of Paris is of course not representative of the whole world. If you live in the tropics, it is likely that you are/will be observing climate change on your own, without the help of an elder or timeserie! Despite the rate of warming is lower than in Paris or high northern latitudes, the climate is much less variable in the tropics. Small changes in climate will thus really stand out from the natural variability.For people living in higher latitudes, are you confident that, based on your own observations of weather, you can affirm that climate is changing? What about people living in tropical regions? And for how much time have you been living where you are?  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14531659033488539.jpg"

It used to be that I could only find blooming magnolia trees in the late spring or early summer.  Now there is not a day in the year when I cannot go out and find abundant magnolia trees in bloom.But the major observation I have comes from the fact that I used to go to the South Pacific, including the Cook Islands, several times a year.  Sometimes I would go to an atoll called Manihiki and stay for a few nights in the village.  A custom in Manihiki was that visitors before they left would plant a coconut on the island.  This was in a line that led down towards the sea.  I noticed over the years that as time passed, the sea level was rising, and had engulfed some of these planted coconut trees, which died because of the rising sea level."

I mentioned to her, it's not about being from ""the country"", it's about what its called now and I understood she wasn't trying to be condescending but she was annoyed with the students and our mainstream media using the term ""green"" as a way to show that we recycle. I let her know that people have been doing that for years in many places. "

Personal responsibility versus Systemic responsibility. Should each of us take responsibility for ALL the consequences of our actions, every choice, every casual whim? How can we know EVERY consequence? How do we cope with the emotional load of trying to think about what every single consequence might be - it is daunting and emotionally draining.Or should our society have systems and structures that can take responsibility for many choices. Who decided all those years ago that the shopping bags that the older woman was using would be plastic bags? The older lady? Or the supermarket?Perhaps she should have thought about that way back when. But surely it would be so so much more efficient for a huge supermarket chain to task 2-3 employees with investigating the science of plastic bags and their disposal, find the consequences and report that to the management of the supermarket and recommend corrective action like 'Lets sell all our customers reusable bags at cost price and stop using plastic bags'. That as a systems level response would be so much more powerful and effective.So too with all the other 'systems' - energy generation, transport etc. The systems operators control the levers, not individuals. Primary responsibility lies with those who control the levers. We have given you control of those levers in trust. Don't abuse that trust."

Since moving to the US and learning about the tick-borne diseases, I have become obsessed with protecting ourselves and our dog.

But the albedo change still occurs.As for your point about temperatures on bare feet, that isn't because the land absorbs more heat.  It is because the energy absorbed by the ground is concentrated in a much smaller volume so the temperature change of the small slice of rock is greater.Water and Rock have similar specific heats. So an equal amount of heat will produce similar temperature changes in similar volumes. But the absorption by the ground is concentrated in a thin slice near the surface, some centimeters at most over a day. All the energy absorbed warms a very small volume of ground so it gets quite hot.In contrast water absorbs down to depths of many 10's of meters and mixing also distributes it as well. So water can absorb much much more heat than the ground and still only see a small temperature rise because that heat is warming a volume 100's to 1000's of times larger.But it is the change in the total heat absorbed that is the ultimate contributor to any climate change."

A few simple principles come to mind. What do other sources say on the topic? What is the basic message, and does the evidence support that message? Are there disingenuous aspects of the argument that have nothing to do with evidence? Climate science in its totality is very complex, but the basic elements of the theory of anthropogenic global warming are quite simple.  Instead of getting bogged down in all the things you feel like you don't know, it's useful to start with what you do know or can quickly find out. Is carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas? would doubling its concentration in the atmosphere cause an increase in the earth's atmospheric and oceanic temperature? Does water expand when heated? how much? Does ice melt when heated? Would the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets raise the sea level if they melted? how much? what amount of sea level rise would be a problem for low-lying areas like south Florida and Bangladesh, or other areas like the eastern seaboard? Then you can start looking into other closely-related questions, and ask: Does the source you are looking at adequately address these questions? Once you take a logical, common-sense approach, I think you'll find it surprisingly easy to sort out the information from the misinformation. As for the role of consensus in the development of scientific knowledge: it's worth considering whether Darwin and Einstein overturned the existing scientific theories or filled a void that wasn't adequately addressed by those theories. The history of the scientific uptake of those theories is worth a look; they weren't as scientifically controversial as you may believe. With respect to global warming theory, I've found that there is a lot of lively scientific debate, but the debates are on things like the feedback roles of clouds and the location of the primary oceanic heat sinks. I don't hear much debate about whether CO2 is an important greenhouse gas or whether the lower atmosphere is warming or, for that matter, whether the earth is round. Scientific consensus and debate are not mutually exclusive. Thanks again for posting your thoughts on this!"

For my own sanity I have pared the required actions down to two thrusts:-1.  We need to educate women, particularly in the Third World.  Educated women tend to have only two or fewer babies so in time the world population will drop and the earth will recover its equilibrium.  We can all play our part in this by switching a lot of our charitable giving to Camfed (Campaign for Female Education - https://camfed.org/)2.  But if that doesn't happen quickly enough and the world warms, so we have to take emergency action on global cooling, the blunt weapon solution recommended in ""Freakonomics"" by Levitt and Dubner (http://freakonomics.com/2009/10/18/global-warming-in-superfreakonomics-the-anatomy-of-a-smear/) is to install a hosepipe supported by helium balloons at each of the north and south poles to allow the controlled injection of sulphur dioxide into the stratoshere to simulate the effect of a major volcanic eruption in forming a ""stratoshield"" to reflect some sunlight back into space.That should prevent human extinction but we could probably speed things up by removing some greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.

But the hard part now is solving the problem of **risen** population.If we go back to his blocks. How do we get the population down? If birth rates fall to replacement - around 2.1 children per woman, then his shuffle of always adding two blocks at the bottom actually goes on and on and population doesn't fall. To get it down we need to start adding smaller blocks at the bottom. If we went to 1.75 children per couple, how many generations before the population is halved?How long for 1.5 children? 1 child per couple. It takes change of that scale, sustained for several generations, to really get the population down. It really needs 1 child per couple for several generations to make serious inroads into the issue. Now imagine Hans' blocks if we do this. Top heavy with blocks at the top. A world of old people and very few young people. A rather maudlin world. And probably hard to sustain for multiple generations - people want children.But a civilised draw down of population, perhaps 1.75 children per woman, would take many generations to achieve serious decline. Into the 22nd century.So, any civilised drawdown can't happen quick enough. An uncivilised drawdown by a 1 child policy will struggle to work. An even more uncivilised approach of increasing the death rate is abomination. And we can't expect people to accept a two tiered society of the affluent and not - everyone has the same right to at least a decent life. So what's left?We need to give everyone a decent life, which may be less than we in the West currently have. Would it be so terrible to live like our grandparents, so long as we retain the really valuable advances like medicine, sanitation etc?Then we need to go through our societies like that proverbial dose of salts, rooting out every instance of waste and inefficiency. We don't want the efficiency an economist might talk about - how to use money efficiently in order to have more. We need efficiency more like an engineer might think about it. How do we produce the required level of goods and services so that we can all have decent lives while consuming the absolute minimum of materials and energy as inputs. Yes we need to make do with less, that is the reduced living standards thing. But just as much we need to produce what we still do need with much fewer inputs.So some examples. - Planned Obsolescence - The throw-away society - Buying something because we 'like shopping' - Consuming anything because of fashion, 'style' appearance, impressing people - Replacing something that still works just because we want to feel some 'newness' - Consuming goods because they give us a tiny increment of more 'convenience' - etc. etc. etc.All have to go. Essentially the central ethos of the Consumer Society has to be killed stone dead.Sound easy?"

Warming of the oceans has pretty steadily increased over that period. There is very patchy data from earlier in the 20th century suggesting little warming but no where near enough to be conclusive.We might look at estimates of past sea levels over longer time scales to try and estimate warming since warmer oceans expand and sea level rises. However, since changes in ice cover is a bigger driver of sea level it is hard to unpick the warming only component from past sea level, particularly since past sea level estimates from say the 19th century aren't that accurate globally.What the warming of the oceans can tell us today, is that this isn't just a case of internal variability. The oceans aren't warming because heat is being transferred there from somewhere else in the climate system. There is no heat source large enough to do that.If heat was being drawn from the air to warm the oceans then air temperatures would be falling by something like 15 deg/decade. That ain't happening.If heat was being drawn from ice to heat them - thermodynamically possible even if there is no clear mechanism - then ice would be frowing by something like 10-50,000 billion tonnes a year. But actually it is shrinking by something like 500 billion tonnes per year. That ain't happening.It isn't being warmed by the land - land temperatures are rising not falling. That ain't happening.It isn't heat generated by humanity. The total rate of human energy consumption is around 18 trillion watts. The oceans are warming at around 350 trillion watts. And it isn't geothermal heat. There isn't more heat flowing into the oceans through the sea floor - the oceans are warming from the top down. And anyway, the total amount of all heat flowing from within the earth - geothermal heat - isn't enough even if it all started to accumulate in the oceans for some reason. Geologists have estimated the flows of all geothermal heat at between 44-47 trillion watts. Many times too small.So the only conclusion left is that something has disturbed the earth's external energy balance, as Sara covered in here recent lecture. Nothing else is big enough to explain the measured changes in ocean heat content. It's a combination of Solar, Albedo or GH Effect. Nothing else fits the evidence. All 'internal variability' arguments don't fit the evidence.In contrast, when we look at older surface temperature measurements, prior to our ability to measure what the oceans are doing, we can't rule out internal variability as a source; small variations in ocean heat can easily change air temperatures, its the dog that wags the atmospheric tail. Now that we know what the atmosphere AND the oceans are doing, we have a much clearer picture."

This was as a result of a change in the nationality of most shipping during WWII between English and American ships. But other parts of the blip were real.It is interesting to look at a map of the world and look at where the major ocean currents go and what drives them. Although there are currents that flow into the north Pacific, the major north/south axis is the Atlantic. Warmer waters from the Gulf Stream makes Europe, Scandinavia and western Russia warmer than they otherwise would be. This effects temperatures as far as the Barentz Sea and perhaps even traces around into the Kara Sea. There is a giant ocean pump that transfers heat up into the north.At the same time, the region just south of Greenland (the area around the sub-polar gyre) and a secondary region north of Iceland are important regions for generating downwelling currents. Water descends to the floor of the Atlantic and flows south along the bottom. This then is replaced by the warm surface waters flowing north.So climate in a significant part of the northern hemisphere is strongly influenced by the strength of those currents in the Atlantic. The Atlantic basin is potentially more subject to variability depending on the variations in those currents than other regions of the globe.Those currents can be impacted by things that influence the rate of that downwelling, particularly large changes in inflow of fresh water into that region. This is thought to have been a significant factor in some of the fluctuations during the melting of the ice sheets after the last ice age.But in addition, there can always be natural fluctuations in any fluid flow, natural beats and pulsations in the flow. So this could easily then influence air temperatures. And since the northern hemisphere has so much more land than the south, its climate is then more likely to respond more strongly to any fluctuations, producing what appears to be a global change when actually it is more regional.This is the land and ocean temperature series from GISS for 3 regions - Northern exatropics, tropics and southern exatropics. Notice how different they are during the 1910-1940's period. The WWII blip seems apparent in the tropics and south. In the north there was a more significant regional change over a longer time frame.![enter image description here][1]And as the discussion in your link mentions, aerosols matter too. And they are also different between the hemispheres, with much more man-made aerosols in the northern hemisphere. It is easy for us to forget now just how significant pollution was in the past. Although for China today, that has returned.Another complicating factor is station coverage. The number of weather stations in the high Arctic was quite limited till around the 1920's.

The examples I have in mind about amplyfing and stabilizing feedback are related to a restaurant. The stock are the clients eating in the restaurant at a particular time. The inflow are the new clients arriving and the outflow the clients leaving. If the clients leaving have negative comments about the food, then the amount of clients arriving will decrease. The quality and variety of the dishes will be worst, and so the comments will get worst. On the other hand, if the comments are good, more people will arrive at the restaurant, which will probably generate a better service."

Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals in a population that can be supported by the resources in the area.  Inflows to a population are immigration (other animals of the same species entering the population from a different area) and birth rate.  Outflows are emigration (animals leaving the population) and death rate.  My example is a hypothetical situation where the population is geographically isolated so there will be no immigration or emigration.   Say you have a population of herbivores that is stable (birth rate = death rate) and feeds on a specific plant.  An event occurs (oil spill, chemical spill, urbanization etc) that removes a portion of the habitat, thereby removing some of the plant that the population of herbivores depends on.  You will see an increase in the death rate due to starvation, and a decrease in the birth rate due to a lack of food and fewer breeding individuals.  This loop will continue until the population stabilizes at a lower carrying capacity (number of individuals in the population) that can be supported by what is left of the habitat.Amplifying feedback loop: This example comes from some of my previous field work.  You have a population of ravens that is stable and occurs in an open landscape (few trees or tall objects).  Ravens nest in trees and on rocky outcrops in the wild.  In urban areas they will nest in/on man-made structures.  This population of ravens is limited by the number of nesting structures in the area.  Now humans come in and build a power plant, including all of the power lines necessary to transport the newly generated power over the landscape.  The ravens now have more structures to nest on, therefore there are more successful breeding pairs due to a lack of competition for suitable nest sites.  The birth rate increases, creating more breeding individuals. This is amplified again because the power lines also help the ravens obtain food with more perching sites in the area.  More food = a higher birth rate.  The population will continue growing until it reaches it's carrying capacity."

This course includes some detail of this but there is much more that can't be included - time constraints and complexity obviously. Looking at past climate is important. It is what climate has actually done before. So in areas where there might be some uncertainties, like perhaps that changes in cloud cover might cancel out the warming from GH gases so there would be little warming, we can look to the past to see how sensitive past climate was to changes. If the past climate didn't have low sensitivity, then it is far less likely that present climate will some how be different.[This][1] is one of the most important recent studies - the PALEOSENS study. It is more a meta-study. They have taken something like 30 studies into past climate that estimated climate sensitivity. They went through the methods used in the studies to harmonize the analyses so they are the best apples vs apples comparison. Then looked at the Climate Sensitivity all these studies produced.And these studies cover time periods from as short as from the most recent Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago, to the entire Phanerozoic period back as far as 420 million years ago.This graph is the key finding. The CS is given as degree C change per watt/M^2 of forcing. To convert this to CS per doubling of CO2 multiply the values by 3.7:![enter image description here][2]Here is another version of the graph, produced by John Cook at [SkepticalScience][3], that has done that calculation.

Our predictions of future climate, which are based on reconstruction of past climate or climate models, are subject to high uncertainties. But on the other hand, most people, and decision-makers, would like climate scientists to predict the exact Earth's future.There are many reasons for which uncertainties in climate science are so high, in this case for estimating climate sensitivity. For example, if you try to infer the climate sensitivity from climate history, your estimate is subject to the quality of the proxy you use to get the past temperature and radiative forcing; the further into the past you look, the larger are the uncertainties. Moreover, the response of Earth temperature to a radiative forcing perturbation depends a lot on Earth's state before the perturbation. Parameters such as continents distributions or the incoming energy from the sun have been changing through Earth history and modulate what the climate response to a CO2 perturbation is.Estimates of climate sensitivity based on climate models are also subject to important uncertainties, for example because clouds remain challenging to model and are a key control on the amplitude of climate response to a CO2 perturbation. Another example of gripping question is the response of the deep ocean circulation (the ""conveyor belt"") to temperature rise and melting of Greenland ice-sheet. A shut-down of this circulation would slow-down the redistribution of heat from the tropics to the higher latitudes, with abrupt changes in regional climates.So there are really plenty of good reasons why these estimates of climate sensitivity are subject to important uncertainties. But I think it is the role of climate scientists to try to explain this as much as possible, and work hard to provide better constrained numbers, but not to cede to the pressure of giving one number and pretend this is the right one."

I would be curious to see how this figure looks like if you use a low concentration scenario (RCP26) or intermediate (RCP45 or RCP60). This figure is not telling the entire story as climate models make projections for all of these scenarios. National politics then make decision based on what scenario they think is acceptable...If you want to assess the performances of climate models, you should instead look at how they reproduce past climate, when the forcing (CO2 concentration, volcanic gases, aerosols,...) is known. For example, below is an updated figure showing observed global mean surface temperatures until 2015 (colored lines), and climate models prediction using the actual CO2 concentrations (ie not the worst case RCP scenario...) (the 3 dashed lines, showing the models mean and spread). You can indeed clearly see that models predictions are mostly above observed temperatures in the 2000's (the so-called ""climate hiatus""), although the difference is not huge. You can also see that observed temperature get closer to model's mean prediction in the 2010's; and with the current El Nino event, 2016's should follow the same trend.The figure has been made by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.![Colored lines correspond to observations, dashed lines correspond to the models mean and spread when using observed forcing (CO2, volcanic gases,...) until 2015][1]  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14532484129849928.png"

It doesn't clearly spell out the forcings used in the model results. Since a lot of this is historical, how much has it used historical data, particularly for aerosols, volcanic eruptions, solar. RCP's apply to future forcings. 2. With both the balloon and satellite data it shows an average of them. It doesn't show the range of results that the different datasets that have been averaged produce. For example, not all the balloon datasets are necessarily equal quality. There are recognised biasing effects in balloon data at higher altitude due to heating effects on the instrument packages from sunlight, cooling effects due to evaporative cooling when passing through clouds etc. Not all the balloon sets are of equal quality. By averaging everything it hides the spread. 3. The graph doesn't clearly state what height in the troposphere we are dealing with. Elsewhere Spencer & Christy have stated that they back calculated the equivalent of the mid tropospheric satellite signal from the model results. If so did they:    3.1. Apply the appropriate land and ocean masks to account the different emissivities of those surfaces as is used in calculating the satellite datasets.    3.2. Mask out the appropriate regions from the model data sets to match the signal coverage areas of the satellites. The high arctic and Antarctic aren't measured in the satellite data. And RSS mask out the Himalayas and Andes, UAH don't.    3.3. If this is meant to be TMT, why have they only used 2 satellite datasets when a third, STAR/NESDIS also exists? STAR/NESDIS satellite data for TMT shows significantly more warming than RSS or UAH.     3.4. No mention of the questions being raised recently about the possibility of a problem with the satellite data in recent years. Satellite and Balloon data were in good agreement up until around 2000 then they have started to diverge, with the balloons showing more warming. The speculation, with no clear answer at present is that when the satellites switched from Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) to Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU) that the AMSU's may have introduced a bias, perhaps an unexpected drift in the instrument. An open question at present, certainly grounds for evaluating the satellite data with some caution.    3.5. In generating the TMT signal from the model data, how many levels of the atmosphere did they use. Since the signal that the satellites record as TMT has components that originate all the way from the surface up to the mid stratosphere, they need to use data from the models for many different levels to generate an apples with apples match. 4. Why focus on just the Tropics? That is only around 1/3 of the earth's surface. What is happening in the mid latitudes compared to the models? The polar regions. By focusing on the tropics they are focusing on an ocean dominated band of the planet. What result do you get with a land dominated band? The whole planet? 5. What do similar analyses show when we look at ocean heat content vs model predictions. Surely that is the more significant metric when we are comparing the performance of the models with observations - that is where over 90% of the heat is going. 6. Finally, what is the level of agreement we **expect** between models and data? Remember, these are climate models, not weather models. How much of any variation over say 10 years is just normal variability that models can't capture?And finally, if they feel this result is significant, why haven't they published it in the scientific literature, including all the details of their methodology which might answer some of the questions I have raised? Putting graphs up on a personal blog with some personal commentary (and testifying before the US Congress using the same material) without revealing their methods to their peers for review really isn't very professional."

As far as I understand, O3 can be found in the troposphere and in the stratosphere. In the former, O3 appears as the result of human activity, being a harmful pollutant. It acts as a GHG (absorbs IR) but because of its low concentration the effect is not significant (much more significant are water vapor and CO2). I am afraid that if Ozone levels dramatically increase at the low troposphere the GH effect would be our last concern. (At this point I do not know if Ozone enhances other gases‰Ûª interactions). In the stratosphere, higher concentrations form the Ozone Layer, an UV layer-trapper which protects and allows life on Earth. In my opinion, Ozone cannot be responsible for the recent rise in average global surface temperatures because no proportional increase has been observed. I mean, there is no correlation between temperature rise and Ozone rise. Moreover, the Ozone Layer has diminished within the stratosphere. As a peer has already mention, this could cause lower UV absorption in the atmosphere and higher absorption on the Earth‰Ûªs surface and therefore surface warms up so more inflow energy to be balance, more warming, more energy given off...amplifying feedback loop:)) But this is not a GH effect, it is shortwave solar radiation which entries straightaway through the atmosphere.

One idea I saw presented recently, was to suspend a giant mirror in space to reflect back some of the incoming solar radiation before it entered the atmosphere. I have major reservations around the feasibility of ideas like this and our ability to reflect just the right amount of radiation. The clearest correlation in the data presented so far is the increase in carbon dioxide levels and the rise in average surface temperatures.

Planting trees reduce the albedo effect and the net effect on CO2 is almost neutral (photosynthesis, respiration and decaying). Am I doing the right thing or not ? I still think that at least it reduces summer heat.  Another related question: should we have urbanistic rules that all roofs should now be white instead of black and houses be painted in light colours to increase reflection to space ? Anybody has idea? Alice from Mont-Saint-Hilaire"

However, I really think that the ""big deal"" remaisn to improve the ""CO2 efficiency"" of our economies. This is a huge challenge for third world or developing countries, where most of the population growth comes from, but also most of the economical growth, which will be associated with more or less CO2 consumption depending on the economical growth path they follow...If you look at UN population projection, we will likely end-up with 9.5 to 13.5 billions people in 2100 (http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/); no need to say 9.5 is preferable in terms of CO2 emissions (and many other challenges, like water or arable land availability). However, if you look at the emissions/capita of developed countries (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC/countries?order=wbapi_data_value_2011%20wbapi_data_value%20wbapi_data_value-first&sort=desc&display=default), differences are much more significant: for example, Switzerland consumed 5 tons of CO2/capita in 2011 vs 17 for the US. Whether countries where population is booming develop their economy toward a swiss-like model (in term of carbon efficiency) or a US-like model will make a much, much bigger difference than whether the population ends up at 9.5 or 13.5 billions people in 2100.This does not mean that trying to limit population growth is not a good idea; this just mean that developing carbon-efficient economy is something that we can not avoid and that should be priority #1."

Based on what I have learned so far in this class, it seems that we understand CO2 and its impact on climate well. Thus, our solutions should be focused on CO2, in my opinion. And the solution that seems obvious to me is a global tax on carbon (I also like cap & trade). It would not be the first time that we taxed a pollutant. Such a tax would help provide the correct signal to energy buyers and users. The funds raised could be used for mitigation and adaptation. Call me crazy if you want, but I also think that nations like the US, which are responsible for most past emissions, should pay a higher carbon tax rate to recognize their role in creating the warming problem. Since higher past emissions allowed the US (and others like it) to develop its economy and accumulate wealth, I don't think it is unreasonable for the rest of the world to expect that we 'give back' some of that accumulated wealth through a higher carbon tax rate. I realize that in practice my ideas are probably controversial and unlikely to get traction in the US any time soon. "

In addition to the issues Thomas raises, there is the termination problem. If CO2 levels get dangerously high and we use something like aerosols to try and produce some cooling, we can't STOP. If we stop the cooling is cancelled out and the warming comes roaring back - rapidly.So any cooling type geoengineering answer needs to be matched by the other form of geoengineering - sequestration. Getting the CO2 out of the atmosphere. There are a number of proposals for how to do that but I am not convinced they are capable of operating at sufficient scale. Some ideas need a vast parallel industrial infrastructure to what we already have.Yet it looks like some form of geoengineering will be required. We are probably past the point where we can hold warming to 2 degrees starting from current emissions rates, without just turning out the lights and plunging the world into darkness, without some form of geoengineering.In the latest IPCC report the range of scenarios that make up the RCP2.6 pathway - the one that might keep temperature rise below 2 degrees long term - virtually all need negative emissions later in the century. The scenarios are already factoring in geoengineering to achieve the goal. And even then temps overshoot the 2 degree bar then come back down again decades later."

Below is a figure (from ""Understanding Recent Stratospheric Climate Change"", Thompson and Solomon, 2009) with the total ozone content anomaly (in Dobson units) for different latitudes bands. The 2 dashed lines indicate the El Chichon and Pinatubo eruptions, 2 of the largest eruptions of the past decades. You can clearly see a decrease of the ozone content after these eruptions at high latitudes.![enter image description here][1]Large stratospheric volcanic eruptions allow us to learn a tons about climate, because it stimulates many different aspect of the climate system: change in the radiative budget, atmospheric chemestry, dynamics feedbacks,... Testing whether a climate model can reproduce climate response to an eruption is also a good test for the model. However, the problem is that there are only a few well observed eruptions. Thus, the global effects, mainly the impact of sulfate gases on Earth radiative balance, are quite well understood. I think the impact of ozone is well understood too. However, we lack of well-observed eruption to understand the detailed response of the climate system to volcanic eruptions, especially regional climate response. Although this is a subject on which we are progressing a lot, there are many debates and unknown left.So I think that you are totally right being concerned by the level of understanding that we have about the climate response to stratospheric aerosols loading, and possible consequences in case we use this to decrease the temperature...  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1454030892482389.jpg"

Sea ice change is one of the potentially quickest responding feedbacks and thus a potential tipping point. A similar one is land snow cover extent. It only needs a few warm years for snow cover extent, particularly in spring, to have a significant impact. In contrast changes such as vegetation and desertification take longer and the difference in albedo isn't as great. But equally, snow and sea ice can recover quicker if conditions changed.The bigger concern as you mention, although they take longer to occur, are the changes that also take a long time to reverse. Dieback of the Amazon for example. Once a rainforest ecology that generates it's own local climate has been converted to savannah for example, it takes a long time for it to reverse. And here the tipping point can come before it is apparent. Drying of the forest may not produce much apparent change at first. But once it has dried to a critical level fire can devastate huge areas quickly. And rain-forest species aren't very fire resistant. In my country Australia many tree species are adapted to fire; they reshoot quickly after fire and many seeds need heat to germinate. Rainforest species largely aren't. Fire kills them and destroys their seeds.So the Amazon is not only being lost to deforestation - although I believe the rate of this has slowed in recent years, but also other changes are happening in addition to that which could all trigger a rapid decline in future decades.It is the tipping points that we can cross before we realise it, and are hard to reverse that are the scary ones.And a small point. Melting sea ice doesn't raise sea level. It is already floating and is a part of the current sea level. If you put an ice cube into a glass of water and let it melt, the water level doesn't rise. It is melting land ice that changes sea level."

For instance, a large portion of China gets its water from the melting of snow and ice in the Himalayas.   As the snow and ice in the Himalayas melt, sooner or later much or all of it will be insufficient to supply water to the rivers in China.  Since many Chinese depend on fishing in these rivers for their primary protein source, and for irrigation for rice crops, the vast shrinking of the water flow in these rivers will cause starvation among millions, and may also cause a population shift to higher ground and a change in crops favoring wheat rather than rice. There may be political problems caused by this situation as it gets worse and worse.

Planting trees reduce the albedo effect and the net effect on CO2 is almost neutral (photosynthesis, respiration and decaying).  Am I doing the right thing or not ?

If atmospheric CO2 goes up when inflows exceed outflows and down when outflows exceed inflows, why the peaks occur in spring and the valleys in fall? Maybe I've got the wrong concept but I thought that photosynthesis happens during the spring...which means that plants need CO2 and take it from the atmosphere, therefore higher outflow. And during fall most plants decay and release CO2 to the atmosphere (higher inflow). That is why I thought peaks are in fall and valleys in spring.Could anyone help me with this?

Making a decision that affects not only your country, but the entire population is not easy, but it often seems that policy makers ""pick and choose"" the types of science they deem to be the most important, leaving out other areas that may have even more value. An example is human behavior, and how many of us in Western countries know about climate change & have some semblance of the science behind it, yet, many are unwilling or unable to make direct changes in their behavior. Governments do not seem to account for this though, and continue to make decisions based on certain scientific areas only. When it comes to policy, I believe we need a much more versatile set of scientific study to cover a multitude of areas. Our lives are complex. Humans are complex. The climate is complex. It would be a tough & lengthy process, but from it I think we would see a lot more equality, compassion, health and more come out of policy, ones that would perhaps feel less ""dictated"" and more ""natural"".

I believe in MindBodySoul for both our health & the health of the planet. It is all connected.Vancouver has had it fairly easy so far when it comes to extreme weather due to climate change, but it's only a matter of time. An example is: we had a level 4 drought last summer and our mountains had basically 0 snow. Vancouver is known for its rain, so residents don't think much about how much water they use. I am taking this course to further my knowledge of Climate Science so I can feel more confident in discussing it with others and in sharing my message about how human health & planetary health are connected, which I hope to write more about on my website & bring to my workplace. I look forward to connecting with you all over the next few weeks, and am amazed by the variety of countries represented here - this is my first time doing a MOOC. :)"

I have a background in engineering and science and have been involved in learning about and advocating for action on climate change for more than 10 years. I am a member of the author team at the website [SkepticalScience.com][1]. Baerbel Winkler one of the teaching assistants here is a colleague there.I figure that with what I have learn't over the last 10 years I can help people starting on that journey to progress on their journey a lot quicker with some signposts. Because this is serious. And with a 1/4 century of delays and obfuscation it is now frighteningly urgent. Climate Change has been described as a 'wicked problem'. It is. A threat from something we can't see, that develops slowly, that reaches critical points decades before the full impacts actually arrive, that has the potential to undermine the foundations of our societies - food security, protection from the elements, loss of the land you live on, security, social cohesion.It is something we can't easily imagine. We have no historical precedents for the idea that this could be possible; unless you ask the paleo-climatologists who study deep time, who can tell you just how bad climate on this planet has been at times in the distant past.And it requires global action, trusting other people, other countries. Thinking on timescales where a decade is short term. Perhaps some sacrifice from us to protect those not yet born. And to understand all of this one needs science which, for most people, is a sort of out-there-in-left-field subject, not quite a part of normal life and how we think.Sound like a simple problem to get our heads around? The heads of everyone else on the planet?And yet, wicked or not, **it is real** and it ain't going to go away without huge effort on our part.  [1]: http://skepticalscience.com/"

I approach this class by witnessing the shrinkage of our famous glaciers in the Rocky Mountains.  Also, Montana is known as an extraction state whereby, now the world--China and others--are buying our coal, rare minerals (besides gold, silver and copper) and crude oil.  All these activities have not only local implications but worldwide consequences as well.  And, are the pine beetle infestations that are decimating our forests from Canada all the way down to the Mexican border exacerbated by the CO2 and warming of our atmosphere--I think so--we do not have the brutal winters anymore to kill off the larvae of the pine beetle--necessary in arresting the spread of the decline of our doug fir, pine, larch, hemlock forests.  The warming also has a contributing factor in the prolonged drought that we are experiencing--now throughout most of North America. ""A healthy forest normally stores significant amounts of carbon. By killing off millions of acres of trees, which then decay or provide fuel for wildfires, the mountain pine beetle has instead turned lodgepole pine forests into a source of carbon emitted into the already overloaded atmosphere.""""The pine beetle epidemic shows how warming temperatures can lead to a problem that, in turn, causes temperatures to rise even further. Such a feedback loop serves to amplify global warming. The added carbon in the atmosphere warms mountain temperatures even more, allowing the beetles to continue to multiply and destroy more trees, which give off more carbon. The feedback loop continues until the preferred host trees are gone.""http://www.climatehotmap.org/hotspot-images/rocky-mountains-co-usa.jpg.http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-locations/rocky-mountains-co-usa.html."

Irrespective of whether the other tipping points have greater climate impacts or not I am pessimistic that humanity in its present form would be around to experience them.My hope is that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events will shake people out of the rather complacent view that prevails today and demand faster action from governments to begin to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

As global temperature increases, the arctic sea ice melts and therefore the reflectance caused by them decreases resulting in higher amount of solar radiation being absorbed. As a result, water's temperature rise and more ice melts. Moreover, this melting leads to a sea level rise which consequently triggers floods. These tipping elements must not remain ink on paper, instead, must be transformed into actions. These elements tend to explain the severity of the situation and more importantly, warn humans of the upcoming consequences if the same emissions of greenhouse gases continues. These tipping elements serve as evidence and as a guide for policy-makers to issue new and strict policies related to greenhouse gases emissions. Therefore, the policymakers can check the situation by returning to its source or the processes in order to propose these policies. Also, these tipping elements guide the policy makers to what elements must be targeted first depending on the degree or level of impact each poses where the most severe elements must be taken into consideration first.In my opinion,one of the most fundamental tipping elements which was not mentioned by Lenton et al., is the Amazon forest since it is one of the most vast forests on Earth and huge acres are being deforested."

According to  Hans Rosling it is unavoidable that the population of the world will grow from 7 billion to 10 billion over the next 50-60 years as young people already alive have babies.  Any human intervention in this is likely to be unacceptable or at least unlikely to be through peaceful agreement.  So are we building up to a disaster?  Is there going to be a fight for available resources and a drop in population through war?  Or is there a modern equivalent of bubonic plague (eg the Ebola scare was scary) for which current antibiotics or other drugs don't work?  Thomas Malthus wrote ""An Essay on the Principle of Population"" in 1798 predicting such responses to over-population but his work has tended to be dismissed by more recent economists.  Is he going to proved right?  Or actually will awareness and especially education of third world women reduce birth rates to one child per woman so the predicted population growth doesn't happen?  Or will we accommodate 10 billion by reducing our present luxurious levels of consumption?  Or will the geo-engineering hosepipes pumping sulphur gases into the stratosphere at the poles be called into play?  Excuse the rambling inconclusive note please!"

You might need to click ""Expand Discussion"" to see more than the first two lines, if you are accessing the discussion through the Discussion page within the [Assignment 1 Discussions area][1].  I think, though, that you are actually seeing everything that was posted by Walter1943 and the following two posts you mentioned.  That first post does end with ""...than a caus"". Sometimes posts get started in areas that might or might not be a great fit.  The thread about sea level rise in that area, might, however, be related since there are impacts from sea level rise.  Another way to access the discussions is to click on ""Discussions"" at the top of any page.  There you'll see everything - all the posts in all areas.  About maps:  There will be three maps in the course.  There's the [Intro Map][2], which is where you have probably already put a pin.  But there are also maps for each of the two Assignments.  These maps are for people to post the essays that they write for the assignments.  So in the end, there will be a map from each Assignments containing stories from people all over the world.  If your pin doesn't show up on the Assignment 1 map, that's OK, because you probably haven't yet completed your essay for Assignment 1.  If your pin no longer shows up on the Intro Map, could you try to ""Add response"" one more time and see if it works?  If it doesn't, please do let us know, and also let us know approximately where you put your pin.  You can also check the ""Progress"" page (link at the top of any page) to ensure you were assigned the points for posting to the Intro Map. Hope this helps!Sara  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+Climate1x+1T2016/courseware/73432a1c4cf3458a9b80cbcc3edb226c/86919ddc2b634048a9c0c9926ff2e983/  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+Climate1x+1T2016/courseware/bd0f39b530354d6682f6d22b77b03669/d8c8fc76a98a4977bdbaf876ec2cddc6/"

It seeks truth. I remember the story of Darwin being challenged by Lord Kelvin about the age of the Earth. If the Earth was as young as Kelvin was presupposing based upon his calculations of cooling, Darwin's theory would not be very believable. Evolutionary changes required much more time than Kelvin was calculating. Then the Curie's discovered radiation, and in a single stroke Kelvin's idea was deemed mistaken, and Darwin was vindicated. Great scientists operating at the same time in thermodynamics, physics, and biology all coalesced and gave us insight into the workings of the biological world. I hope to get to those truths in this course too - but I consider weather & climate another level altogether in terms of complexity as it is difficult to model it in a system the size of the Earth. I trust scientists to a large degree - and most of the public does too. But the question remains, to what degree must we act even if it is decided unanimously that our carbon production is to blame for some warming. Who should sacrifice, and how much? The fact of the matter is that environmentalism is a pursuit afforded most easily by the wealthy. Leopold and Muir were not paupers. If your main motivation is feeding yourself for that day, you could probably care less about burning wood versus coal versus natural gas. And the fact that the UK, western Europe, the U.S. and other countries are wealthy is in no small part due to our energy consumption which led to great wealth. Can we deny that path to lesser developed nations?"

Without it, no terrestrial plants, no grass, no animals on land. Quite important if you don't own gills.I think ozone is a very appropriate gas to discuss in conjunction with CO2 and the other greenhouse gases because its introduction into the atmosphere necessitated a similar global response from what I understand. The CFCs that were used for a period of time depleted stratospheric ozone. Without that layer, a greater percentage of harmful UV light can reach the Earth's surface and cause DNA damage, leading to cancer in humans. If CFC refrigerant or propellant is cheaper, and possibly even more effective than other choices, should we as a global community tell every country that they can no longer use the ozone-depleting CFC? My vote is yes, that is a warranted response to the crisis. And since the hole's greatest extent used to be around the South Pole, Chile and Argentina should care quite a bit. More than Mexico for example.If this were a serious enough problem, as in virtually all people were developing skin cancer - a top down response would be necessary. Companies which manufactured the substance would need to be taken over/destroyed. And I would be for that.A bit tangential, but what about heroin? If country ""A"" produced huge quantities of heroin, and sold it country ""B"", where many people died, could country ""B"" destroy those farms producing the opium poppies? Even if country ""B"" didn't have huge numbers of deaths, it decreases the productivity of its people. It increases country B's prison population. Can country ""B"" destroy farms, and farmers?My question is, how many people does the production have to effect, and how seriously? Ozone is a life and death gas, and it effects virtually everyone, especially those of us low on melanin. Who gets to decide when action is deserved, and how severe that action is to be? I would like to decide."

This is probably best done by educating women particularly in the Third World  - see Hans Rosling's videos on TED and YouTube - educated women tend to have 2 babies or less.  The Campaign for Female Education (CamFed) is a worthy charity working in this area.  But, as Hans Rosling demonstrates, it is inevitable that world population will hit 10 billion by 2050 as women already alive (girls at present) have 2 babies.  Only then will population stabilise and start to decline.So we need to do something else in the medium term.  And this is the difficult area.  Cutting emissions is going to happen anyway, the momentum is there.  But possibly not fast enough.  Better reflecting sounds promising - we've seen plans for driverless boats puffing nice clean fluffy clouds into the sky - feasibility unknown.  Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - feasibility dubious.

It blows my mind. So we know that the GH effect is a key issue to be addressed and the world is struggling not to find solutions because they are already familiar but just to implement them. Let's take into account that, for example, electric cars where invented the day after the fire was discovered. Green energies are far developed but mysterious forces avoid their implementation wordwide. Another example could be how human activity is changing the hydrosphere by building up dams, varying the course of the rivers or altering shores. More natural and under-control solutions are not being taken into account and we want to inject sulphur gasses into the stratosphere or create more cloud cover? Seriously?? If Julio Verne came back to life, he would be delighted :))I am aware that we are considering these options in case the temperature rises dramatically within the next decades but I cannot stop thinking that common sense efforts are not being made. Planning the future without acting in the present. That is not a good plan. The Earth's systems are incredibly perfect but we insist in altering them in a very violent way. So, how can humans attempt to counteract climate change by influencing energy flows, either through changing reflectivity, or through changing the greenhouse effect? For the latter, we should reduced the carbon dioxide emissions (no fossil fuels, turn into ""green"" and so on). This will have effects on the reflection rates (empowering ice sheet's and glaciers' albedo for example and therefore cooling temperatures), which can be influenced as well by balancing forests and croplands. And for those who claim that we cannot act individually, thinking ahead which products and services do we consume could be a good start. "

The signs of a warmer winter are all around us in Montreal; a friend claims to have seen a cyclist wearing shorts, another a shirtless man jogging in the streets of Montreal, both sightings where on Christmas Eve; retailers in Eastern Canada are having a hard time selling their stocks of winter apparel as many people have little use for them; and just two days ago, an ant infestation in my home had me laying out ant traps for the first time in the over 20 years I‰Ûªve been there (Marowits 2016). You could almost be led to think that any day now the scent of fresh tree blossoms and flowers will be perfuming the air. This unusual weather got me interested in knowing whether it is particularly warm for this time of year. So I did what I usually first do when I want to compare weather to the past, I called my mom but I can‰Ûªt go on my mother‰Ûªs usually trustworthy memory alone so I did a bit of research to see if this was just an anomaly or part of the larger trend of climate change. What I found was that this timid winter is both the consequence of climate change and the weather event El Nino.First let me give a bit of context to our warmer winter by looking at the past. Although it too soon to compare January to historical data,  this last December in Quebec beat a number of records.  In Montreal, we saw 27 days consecutive days where the maximum temperature was equal to or superior to 0å¡C, massacring the previous record of 14 set in 2001 according to MÌ©tÌ©oMedia (MÌ©tÌ©oMÌ©dia, 2016).   We also beat the 2001 record for the highest average monthly temperature for the whole Quebec of -0.4å¡C by a whopping 2.4å¡C when the average reached 2å¡C. December was also the first time since meteorological records started that the temperature passed 20å¡C in Quebec (MÌ©tÌ©oMÌ©dia, 2016). Looking at these number, it is clear that December was indeed warmer. So why the warmer weather? Scientists have been warning us that average global temperature has been rising. In the latest IPCC report, scientists affirmed with virtually certainty that the climate has been and will continue to get warmer and that there will be fewer cold days and nights (IPCC, 2013). As we continue to dump large amounts of a carbon into the atmosphere primarily through the burning of fossil fuels, the average global temperature is expected to rise over the coming decades as concentrations of CO2 increase in the atmosphere (Heede, 2013). According to a study published in Environmental Research Letters, ‰ÛÏwinter temperatures in Canada have increased by more than 2.5C‰Ûù since 1950 (Damyanov & al., 2012). Add to this the fact that we are currently experiencing the effects of a particularly strong El Nino - an natural event disrupting ocean temperatures that reoccurs every few years -  that is bringing warm air from the Pacific and you got an exceptionally warm winter (Theresa Do, 2015). University of British Columbia professor stated it best: ‰ÛÏEl Nino plus global warming means a record-breaking warm winter"" (Theresa Do, 2015). From this we can assume with some confidence that as years go by we will be experiencing warmer winters  than the one we are currently experiencing here in Montreal. Winter will no longer be the same. Less cold days during the winter will likely mean less overall snow, less outdoor ice hockey more shirtless joggers, less people buying winter gear, and it might also mean ants will become a permanent fixture in my household year round (Damyanov & al., 2012). Damyanov, N.

Amongst the muted browns and greens of the temperate forest, it's bright red and purple bark stands out and makes this tree seem like a breath of fresh air from drier, warmer subtropical climates. ![bright-coloured annually peeling bark of a healthy Arbutus tree][2]When i first bought my small piece of land on Bowen Island in 2007, there were about 20 medium to large arbutus trees on the lot. There were a couple of dead tree, and many had dead branches amongst the live ones. Eight years later, all but two of these magnificent trees are dead. The pattern of decline was that individual branches died each year until there were no living branches left, and all size and age classes were affected. This decline is evident in the forest around my house, and pockets of healthy arbutus trees farther afield now are starting to be affected. ![A small Arbutus tree in the process of decline][3]I've asked around about what might be causing this decline, and no one has a good idea; Arbutus is not a commercial tree species and so there isn't much funding to study it. My hunch is that the decline is primarily caused by an alien invasive root fungus like *Phytophthera*. However, I'm cognizant of the potential for climate change to exacerbate other ecological threats. Climate change has been an important factor in [other disease and pest outbreaks in British Columbia][4], through stressing trees and providing more favourable conditions for insects and fungal diseases. Much like in political conflict, climate change can act as a ""threat multiplier"" for other ecosystem disturbances. It's often said that change is the only constant ecosystems. The cause for those changes are often complex and sometimes unknown. In a shifting climate, the pace of change is likely to increase, and the changes are likely to be more catastrophic. As local climates change, it will be increasingly irrelevant to ask whether or not an observed ecological change is related to climate change. Climate change is likely to become interwoven into all aspects of ecosystem function.  The arbutus decline in my area is an enigma. Even still, it alerts me to the potential to observe and document significant ecological changes that may be related to climate change. Local residents are able to closely observe their surrounding environments, and can act as the eyes and ears of the scientific community. The next step is to alert a forest health scientist about this... who perhaps may find this decline worthy of further investigation. I'm curious, do any of you have any observations of your own local ecosystems that might be related to climate change but that you aren't sure about?   [1]: https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zbcXpvxdgZyc.kFGdK6J_xF7s&hl=en_US  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14525396668574242.jpg  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14525394816810763.jpg  [4]: https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/scv/scv447.pdf"

Here are my thoughts:- Climate science is complicated. If weather forecasters struggle getting local weather right just for the next day, think of how hard it is to model the global climate system several years out. Because the science is complicated, it takes a lot of skill to educate the public in a way that moves the conversation forward. I suspect this education effort will take years and some people won‰Ûªt be convinced until they feel the effects of changing climate personally.- Science by its nature is subject to revision. This is why the scientific method works but I do think that this is also why science is vulnerable to attacks by those motivated by personal/religious beliefs or political/financial interests.  - Lack of a central authority that the public can trust does not help. More generally, is there any central authority left that is worthy of our trust? If not, who should be the one to convince the public? My answer is peers!- Finally, I think some people refuse to accept the science because that would force them to have to think about what they are going to do about it. Loss aversion and status quo bias  are powerful sources of inertia for most of us. "

I understand the chemistry and physics to a large extent, and I think the case has been made fairly strongly that man has had an impact on global carbon budgets. But I really don't like the premise behind the IPCC at all. Here is a body funded largely by the U.S. (over 50%), and associated with the U.N., also largely funded by the U.S. telling the U.S. that it needs to pay poorer nations billions of dollars. This is a shakedown. We pay 567 M USD to the U.N. per year, and dozens of countries pay less than 1,000 USD per year and have the same voting rights as the U.S. I am first and foremost a person of science, and I think that science will drive the solution to climate change - but I would consider myself in the adapt to the repercussions of climate change camp for many reasons. One being the utter distrust that I have in rest of the world behaving any different than we do regarding carbon emissions. When populations become prosperous, they will consume just as we do in the west. Transferring billions of dollars to other countries to pay for our consumption sins is not something I would support.As the article pointed out, Canada had a 26% increase in carbon emissions after the Kyoto talks in 1990. Talk is cheap, and all countries are more motivated by jobs and income than the possibility of rising tides. Canada makes plentiful but dirty petroleum products. I would be willing to bet that they do not forbid oil sands mining as part of their constitution. We all act in our self-interest as countries, and for now, I will be a vocal proponent for the U.S. camp."

However, there are tons of tricky issues that are still unresolved.One example is the very popular geo-engineering scenario of injecting sulfur gases in the stratosphere, as described by Neilchisman above. It is true that the basic concept behind this idea is quite well understood: in the stratosphere, sulfur gases are transformed into sulfate aerosols, stay for years in the stratosphere, and backscatter shortwave (sunlight) radiation, thus decreasing the energy received by Earth and , on average, decreasing the surface temperature. This is what happen for large volcanic eruptions, which inspired this ""solution"".However, what is not that well understood yet are the regional impacts of such sulfur injection. Depending on where the sulfur is injected, there are strong evidences that winter gets warmer in some regions of the Northern hemisphere. There are also evidences that injection of sulfate aerosols increase the probability of El-Nino events, which is not a good thing to decrease Earth average temperature... Significant reduction of precipitations associated with the monsoon over South-eastern Asia is another potential consequencs, with issues for agriculture there. You can learn more about potential impacts in this (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.192/abstract) review of impact of volcanoes on climate if you are interested.So even though on average, injecting sulfur would likely reduce Earth temperature, some regions of the world might no see this effect, or even suffer from other dramatic changes in regional climate. The feasibility of sulfur injection can also be debated: sulfur gases needs OH radicals in order to be converted in sulfur aerosols, which then change the radiative balance. OH radicals are depleted after large volcanic eruptions; what if we continuously inject sulfur gases in the atmosphere? For how much time can the conversion of sulfur gases to aerosols be efficient?Another key geopolitical issue, assuming that this solution can work, is to know who will control the ""world thermomether""? Say US and China have different views of what should be the world average temperature and thus of how much sulfur we should inject in the stratosphere, could this lead to major conflicts? Or to uncontrolled injections from different countries?"

So if you replace land with water in a region due to inundation, that region will now absorb extra sunlight and contribute to warming. So this is adding a bit more warming when warming is already happening. And the reverse when sea level falls. But the effect depends on there being large changes in sea level to be significant. And expansion or retreat of snow and ice has a much bigger effect - more land can be effected and the difference in absorption between land and ice is bigger than the difference between land and water.

We dried clothes on a line, not in an energy-gobbling machine burning up 220 volts. Wind & solar power really did dry our clothes back in our days. Kids got hand-me-down clothes from their brothers or sisters, not always brand-new clothing. . . . But that young lady is right; we didn't have the ""green thing"" back in our day.   Back then we had one radio, in the house -- not a TV in every room. And if anyone did own a TV, it had a small screen the size of a handkerchief (remember them?), not a screen the size of a football pitch. When cooking we blended & stirred by hand coz we didn't have electric machines to do everything for us. When we packaged a fragile item to send by post, we used layers of old newspapers to cushion it, not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap. Back then, we didn't fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut the lawn. We used a push mower that ran on human power. We exercised by working so we didn't need to go to a health club to run on treadmills that operate on electricity., , , , But she's right; we didn't have the ""green thing"" back then.  We drank from a tap or fountain when we were thirsty instead of using a cup or a plastic bottle every time we had a drink of water. We refilled writing pens with ink instead of buying a new pen, & we replaced the razor blade in a razor instead of throwing away the whole razor just because the blade got dull.  But we didn't have the ""green thing"" back then. Back then, people took the bus & kids rode bikes to school or walked instead of turning their mothers into a 24-hour taxi service in the family's expensive car or van, which cost what a whole house did before the ""green thing""..  Oh and we had one electrical outlet in a room, not an entire bank of sockets to power a dozen appliances. And we didn't need a computerized gadget to receive a signal beamed from satellites 23,000 miles out in space in order to find the nearest leisure park.. . . . But it so sad this current generation laments how wasteful we old folks were just because we didn't have the ""green thing"" back then?""

However, science is not my strong point and I don't really understand much of the science behind it.I do not have a science background.  My background is on the social sciences.

Methane absorbs infrared radiation in a part of the spectrum where emissions from the earth aren't as high. CO2 is more active in that part of the spectrum where emissions are stronger. So why is Methane described as being so influential?The idea is how much extra effect adding some more gas has. The effect of each of the GH gases reduces roughly exponentially. Doubling the quantity has a certain effect, doubling again a similar effect. So raising CO2 from 280 to 540 ppm has an effect. 540 to 1080 ppm a similar effect, 1080 to 2160 a similar effect, and so on.Similarly with methane. But methane's current concentration is very much lower than CO2 - less than 2 parts per million - so that its concentration is usually expressed in parts per billion. So adding 2 ppm more of CO2 only has a very small effect, while adding 2ppm of methane for example would double the effect from methane. And the differing impact it has over time is because methane doesn't last in the atmosphere. It breaks down chemically over a number of years. So if we add a pulse of methane, years later its effect has reduced since the methane is being broken down.And it gets broken down into ... CO2 and water. So methane has a stronger impact in the shorter term, then becomes a very small part of increasing the impact of CO2. But for overall methane levels to build up, and stay higher, the sources of methane have to increase and stay high. This is why tackling human sources where we can is useful, it can contribute to bringing the methane concentrations down, rather than just stopping them from rising.And one of the big risks wrt methane is melting of Arctic permafrost. There are vast amounts of carbon frozen there, when it melts some of that is released as methane so it's short term impact is higher, and there is enough carbon there to emit methane for centuries."

The simplest is basic mass balance. We know roughly how much CO2 we are adding to the atmosphere every year because we have the economic statistics for how much coal oil and gas we consume. And then it is just basic chemistry to work out how much CO2 is produced from them. Around 35 billion tonnes of CO2. Atmospheric CO2 is rising at around 2.25 part per million (ppm) per year. That is ppmv - by volume, so counting by number of molecules, not their weight. The atmosphere [weighs][1] around 5.15 *10^21 gramsAverage molar mass of the atmosphere is around 29 grams/mol so that means the atmosphere contains around 1.78 *10^20 moles of gas.2.25/1000000 of this is around 4*10^14 moles of CO2. CO2 has a molecular mass of 44 so 1 mole of CO2 weighs 44 grams. So the extra CO2 we measure in the atmosphere each year is around1.76 * 10^16 grams, 17.6 billion tonnes.About half of the mass we are adding each year. So 1/2 of our emissions are being removed from the atmosphere each year and going somewhere else. Absorption by the oceans is one location.The rise in CO2 can't be coming from outgassing from the oceans because that doesn't explain where our CO2 is going.There are other arguments.  1. The source of extra CO2 must be depleted in the Carbon13 form of CO2 since C13 levels in the atmosphere as a percentage are dropping. CO2 in the oceans isn't C13 depleted. Modern organic matter and ancient organic matter (fossil fuels) is C13 depleted so the change in the atmosphere can't be coming from ocean outgasing but can come from burning organic matter or FF. 2. [Henry's Law][2] from chemistry governs the balance between the amounts of gas in the atmosphere and dissolved in a liquid. And if the concentration in the air rises, their must be a compensation where some of this is absorbed by the oceans. Although there is a temperature dependency to Henry's Law this isn't strong enough to compensate for this need to absorb. 3. If it were ocean outgasing then since there is more ocean in the southern hemisphere, we would expect CO2 levels to be rising more there with the northern hemisphere lagging. When actually the reverse is happening, with the southern lagging the northern by several ppm.  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law"

If it were low, it would have to be due to some sort of negative cloud feedback - the other major feedbacks, net water vapour and surface albedo all tend to be positive feedbacks. So a low sensitivity requires a net negative cloud feedback.But any cloud feedback would apply irrespective of what is causing any climate shift so we would expect to see this reflected in past climate. And we don't.Could a cloud feedback be one-way, only cutting in at around this temperature and above, so large cooling changes are possible but not large warming changes? The ice core data doesn't rule this out since it only shows what happened during cooling. But deeper paleoclimate does rule that out. The earth has been warmer than today for most of the past 500 million years, sometimes frighteningly so. Fine if you are a cold blooded dinosaur perhaps, not so good for us warm blooded mammals.So if the earth could be so much warmer in the past, apparently clouds don't have some feedback that stops warming."

I think if it were possible to run with an abrupt 100% reduction in emissions, then the average temperature change through year 2100 would probably tend to zero.

The US had many [nitrate][1] factories that needed a new market after WWII - as a result, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer took off. Something similar seems to have happened with [pesticides][2].

But without nitrate fertiliser we would not achieve anything like the yields we do. One figure I came across said the difference in crop yields per hectare between subsistence agriculture in places like Africa and Western, high-tech mono-culture farming is something like 10 times! And fertilisers are a major part of this. Without western farming methods and fertiliser, even with all the problems that they cause, we probably wouldn't be able to feed the world. Because essentially what nitrogenous fertilisers do is replace the nitrogen compounds removed from the soil when we grow a crop and ship it off somewhere else. And it doesn't matter whether that is to a supermarket on the other side of the world, or a village 200 meters away.  When we remove plant material from a piece of land, we need to replace the key nutrients that we have removed. Many traditional farming practices returned material back to the field such as by using night-soil. Fields were left fallow to recover soil structure. And nitrogen fixing crops like clover can be planted then plowed in. All this protects the soil structure and health which is great. But those fields that are undergoing 'repair agriculture' aren't growing food! So food production is much lower. In the late 60's/70's the Green Revolution began and it transformed agricultural productivity. Prior to that you had people like Paul Erlich predicting mass famine in future decades. That was averted. But to do it we industrialised agriculture - machinery, fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, artificial irrigation, massive plant breeding programs etc. Which have caused a developing huge impact on soils and other problems. And that can't continue for ever.But if we hadn't, the end of the 20th century would have seen mass famines, social collapse and disasters."

I also wonder how much more efficient our organic/traditional practices would be today if we had invested 50+ years of research to make them better. There is recent [evidence][1] that the yield gap between traditional and organic methods can be narrowed with more thoughtful application of rotation farming, for example.

But there is a reason the terminology is used.Since the sources of carbon that produce carbon dioxide are many and varied - coal, methane, all sorts of hydrocarbons in fuels, carbohydrates like the cellulose in wood etc. - a common convention in the scientific literature is to refer to the carbon content of a material so that makes it easier to do the accounting. You just need to do the conversion when going from one to the other.3.67 kilograms of CO2 contains 1 kilogram of carbon.So our annual emissions of CO2 of around 35-37 billion tonnes can also be described as 10 billion tonnes of carbon.So be alert to whether a number refers for example to GtC, or GtCO2."

The CaCO3 breaks down to produce Ca^2+ and CO3^2-, which helps buffer (counteract) the acidity produced by adding CO2.  The effect acts in the direction of increasing pH again (making it less acidic), so this is a stabilizing feedback.  Here's a very short article with the basics (the part about dissolution is at the end).

Humans can be surprisingly bad at absorbing information that runs counter to our views. And we can inadvertently reinforce them with what we say.A common approach might be to say 'There is a myth that says yadda yadda yadda, but actually the truth is rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb'. If your 'rhubarb' is too long and detailed then the person may actually end up recalling the conversation as being 'yadda yadda yadda'. Strange but True.The better approach is Fact-Myth-Rebuttal. State the 'rhubarb' first, then follow with 'but there is a fallacy or myth that says yadda. Obviously this is wrong because of rhubarb'.Mention the myth after stating the facts but label it from the start as faulty, mentally cue people to be on guard against the idea. Then show how the facts rebut it.If you want to learn more about actually countering denial in climate science there is another edX MOOC - [Denial101X][1] - that address this, the psychology of tackling denial.

Planting more trees/forests is one way to help, but it won't amount to a whole lot of carbon capture, unfortunately. Still worth doing anyway as forests have other uses besides carbon sinks.2. Creating and burying large quantities of biochar deep within the ocean (or deep inside abandoned mines/wells) is another way, but as far as I know we don't have any means of doing that on the global industrial scale required yet. The billions of tons required are non-trivial. Still, that's a solvable problem once enough R&D $$$ are thrown at it. I suspect that money will start to become available once governments realize their chances of staying in power during a global catastrophe of rising ocean levels, droughts, and salinated formerly-arable land are slim.Some info on biochar for those who haven't heard of it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar3. Even more speculatively, bio-engineering phytoplankton that absorb extra CO2 during their life cycle is another one that could help, although I admit that one is very far out. Appropriately-designed phytoplankton could accelerate the oceanic uptake of CO2 without making the water more acidic, although we're then left with the potential problem of the phytoplankton becoming ""too much of a good thing"" and causing problems of their own down the line.4. I also heard about this pilot project to capture CO2 for industrial uses but the $ value of CO2 isn't very high and this is only good for 1 million metric tons a day:http://www.powermag.com/carbon-engineering-launches-novel-carbon-capture-pilot-project-in-canada/Still, it's better than nothing and might point the way to something bigger and better in the future. One of the intermediate steps is calcium carbonate and (as they mention in the article) this might be suitable for long-term burial. But surely not in the ocean, so it's not as desirable as biochar in that respect.Hope this helps the discussion get started.P.S. The automatic numbering isn't working.

Once CO2 has diffused into the atmosphere you are looking at concentrations 500 times lower than that.So carbon capture from biofuels requires that we build an infrastructure to grow huge amounts of plant matter, transport it to power stations and burn it, capture it as goes up the smoke stack, transport it **somewhere else** to sequester it as CO2 underground. But plants are actually very inefficient when it comes to converting CO2 to organic matter - I have read that the efficiency of photosynthesis is only around 1%. Consider that the annual cycle of CO2 levels in the atmosphere due to the seasonal cycle of plants, particularly deciduous plants, produces something like +/- 4 ppm variation. If we wanted to use biofuels to capture CO2, on a scale comparable to the rate we are currently emitting it, we would need to replicate something like 50% of the global annual biological cycle, capture it and store it. 50%! If we needed to do it faster than that we might be looking at 100%, 200%.If we want to use conventional technologies - machines - to capture CO2 from the air we can do it much more efficiently than photosynthesis can. But we need to build a vast industrial infrastructure to do it. Perhaps as large as our current energy infrastructure. And supply power to drive it. Then do the infrastructure to bury it.Similarly, carbon storage in soils/biochar has some promise. But we still have to live with the inefficiencies of photosynthesis, then the materials handling logistics of gathering it, burning it, and burying it. On scales of 10's of billions of tonnes per year.Next are more organic type approaches. Crushing large amounts of rock like Olivine and spreading it to try and accelerate the natural weathering cycle - draw CO2 out of the atmosphere and eventually deposit it as calcium carbonate and similar minerals on the sea floor. Conceptually the idea has merit but what I have read so far has a strong emphasis on the above ground processes. The chemistry of what happens in the air and on land, the crushing rates, areas to be covered etc. But the question of whether these above-the-waves changes will flow through to significantly increased sedimentation rates **within** the oceans seems to get very little attention. When I see ocean chemists and geologists getting on board with the idea I might be more confident.There are other ideas like iron fertilisation of the oceans to increase plankton activity and thus sequester carbon on the sea floor as the plankton dies. Again, an organic, systems approach rather than a 'big-iron', engineering approach. But the jury is still out.Personally I think we will need to find a systems-thinking, 'organic' approach using new chemistry, to convert carbon to a relatively inert form that can be sequestered anywhere in the environment. Conventional ideas won't work. But sadly I am not a chemist. So I don't know what the answer is. But I don't think conventional approaches to this problem will be up to the task. We need paradigm changing chemistry."

I have tried to do a little extra reading on the state of the science - and book called ""Behind the Curve"" by Joshua Howe. The book discusses how much of the early work in atmospheric science was possible because of the Cold War applications. So we were not pouring money into atmospheric science for humanitarian reasons or as a noble scientific pursuit. It was all about the Soviets, Sputnik, altering weather patterns, nuclear fallout. That prompted our politicians to fund a science that would have otherwise floundered. Furthermore - I read in the same book about some of an early (1972) U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. It became an ideological battle between the LDCs (lesser developed countries) and the ""rich nations"". China used the terms ""victim"" and ""culprit"" countries. While the Cold War terminology has largely come to pass - I still see this as a political problem. Convincing rich, culprit countries to pay poor, victim countries will be a tough sell. Only when the rich countries are prospering will we be able to secure funding for the LDCs. When Canada, the UK, U.S., France, Germany etc. are all flush with extra cash, we will be able discuss cap and trade, emissions limits, subsidizing green energy, giving away grants to LDCs, etc. When ordinary Americans are feeling the pinch of lower wages and eroding job security, the environment takes a back seat. If Trump or Cruz gets elected this year, good luck with carbon for the next four years. At a minimum, the U.S. will not be taking the lead during that time period."

RCP3PD can be achieved on two levels: the first being ceasing the excessive burning of fossil fuels and the second being removal of the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Regarding the first level and since burning fossil fuels provides an essential need which is electricity, then an alternative is to switch to renewable energy as the sustainable and green source of energy. Well I have learned in a previous online course that it only takes a part of Nevada Desert covered with solar panel to provide energy to the whole world. Therefore, diminishing the huge emissions of carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels only requires a keen view towards the existing renewable energy sources. Moreover, and even though this field requires further research, electric cars (where the electricity comes from solar energy and not burning of fossil fuels) can be the alternative to our diesel and gasoline-powered- cars that possess a remarkable contribution in the carbon dioxide emissions. Regarding the second level, one way to achieve it is by afforestation, where we minimize the land use for agricultural purposes and plant the forest since they play a major role in CO2 absorption. Moreover, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can also be a contributor in decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations but this field needs more research and development"

Improvements in all areas of the planet will naturally follow.I am also not a fan of the belief that technology can save us from ourselves.  In just 150 years we have managed to cause problems which will take the Earth hundreds of thousands of years to recover from and the most affected - the animals and plants whose extinction we have caused - won't be there to see it.  Again, to use an example from modern culture, does anyone think giving Nick Leeson MORE money to speculate with would have been even MORE helpful to Barings Bank?A very helpful book which brought everything going on in the world politically and, by extension, ecologically into focus for me is ""Why Nations Fail"" by Daron Acemo€Ùlu and James A. Robinson.  Everything about the petro chemical world has been extractive and exploitative.  Until we develop innovative and inclusive ways and policies of countering that behaviour, we're still in for a rough ride.  Personally, I think the Age of the Scientist is sorely needed and long overdue.  I have had it with politicians hijacking science and using it for political/corporate gains.  I don't go to my local politician to check if I have a throat infection or diagnose a heart attack and I don't want ANY politician funded by Big Oil to tell me if Climate Change is real or not.  Gravity works the same in conservative households as it does in liberal households.  There is no Gravity lobby in the US which donates money to whichever politician will most support it in the House and Senate.  The laws of physics are not for sale."

Usually it is an over-simplistic, brute force, 'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead' crude application of science by commercial, social and political forces. Whereas I can imagine, although I don't know if I will live to see it, a world where there is a fantastic fusion of systems thinking, deep scientific understanding and an evolved, developed understanding of human psychology. I always agreed with the concept of 'Appropriate Technology'. Whereas things like the 'Small is Beautiful' movement always sounded wrong. Small is beautiful when it is appropriate.Big is beautiful when it is appropriate.Simple is beautiful when it is appropriate.Complex is beautiful when it is appropriate.The best outcomes come from intelligent, organic, sensitive, and highly informed and knowledgeable fusions of everything from the very simplest to the most complex. They are all just pieces in the jigsaw puzzle.And many of the worlds scientists are chomping-at-the-bit to try and use their expertise to help build that. It is the rest of society that often stymies them with our desire for simple.Burn Baby Burn and lets have more economic growth and more consumer society shiny baubles every year is too simple. Small Is Beautiful is too simple.Simple doesn't work. It is a comforting but dangerous fantasy. Since the real world ain't simple (thank GOD, that would be boring), our response to it can't be either."

A dozen   people with fire, in the right situation, can transform 1000's of   hectares in a few weeks. If they do that every few years, they can   make permanent changes. - If one generation burns a forest, subsequent generations only need to prevent seedlings from regrowing to make the change permanent. - One generation can dig drainage ditches that over hundreds of years drain peat bogs or marshlands.Perhaps it isn't the direct actions we can imagine - stone axes, simple ploughs, direct agriculture etc. - that matter. It is when small actions like lighting a fire can be magnified across a landscape that big changes can occur.Take a modern example of how ecosystems can be impacted. DDT wiped out kelp forests in the ocean along the American west coast. Huh. DDT kills animals not kelp!.Yes but. DDT kills Sea Otters. And Sea Otters love feeding on Sea Urchins. And Sea Urchins feed on kelp. So when DDT decimated Sea Otter populations, Sea Urchin populations exploded, and they wiped out kelp forests. When the DDT poisoning was reversed, Sea Otter populations started to recover, sea urchin populations declined, and kelp forests recovered.Perhaps it isn't the direct consequences of what a few million people did that matters, it was the multiplier effect of the indirect consequences."

I mean, it is not about obtaining accurate data but understanding how a system with multiple variables works and set up TRENDS. My previous mistake was to consider climate models as predictors, tools for predicting the future. I now understand that is not only about the future but also about the past. It is about comprehension. And because some parts of the climate system are already perfectly understood, it is now possible to predict future events with great certainty. Let‰Ûªs say for example how easy energy balance models are able to create pretty realistic future scenarios.Concerning the question ‰ÛÏare all climate models useful‰Ûù? I would say no‰Û_partially. Models are very useful but I guess it is important to distinguish between those which can be reliable and those which are not. And I as far as I understand, models (i.e. complex Earth System Models) with high resolution and far too many variables have greater possibilities of mismatch. But this is also a paradox because developing and improving these models is the way to obtain better and more accurate models in the future. So, somehow, they are useful as well. It is about testing, learning and improving. I have to admit how surprisingly is the fact that computer power in the high-tech era appears as a constraint for models development. Incredible. Never thought about that. During this Module 5 we all found several examples of models almost matching the observed data. Models representing atmospheric temperatures, surface temperature and carbon dioxide rise, etc. Moreover, scientist admit that the results are consistent (and therefore compatible) in regard to other models‰Ûª outputs in the world (taking into account different approaches and choices).

All of the New England states including New Hampshire experience four seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. New Hampshire has a ‰ÛÏhumid continental climate‰Ûù which means the state receives precipitation throughout the whole year.  New Hampshire is a very rural, green state. It‰Ûªs well known for its famous ski resorts, its giant fresh-water lakes for vacation homes, its large-dense forests, as well as being home to the famous Franconia Notch mountain range within the Appalachian trail. Many people, such as myself, are active and enjoy the vast amounts of natural and beautiful scenery that New Hampshire has in various forms such as hiking, camping, kayaking, snowboarding and more. It‰Ûªs probably why a large majority of people from New Hampshire participate in or support the preservation of the natural beauty that we have. Unfortunately, there‰Ûªs a lot of work to do before we know that this happy oasis can be saved. One of the first steps to combatting this is by cutting Carbon emissions in New Hampshire.The effects of the climate changing can already be seen in New Hampshire.  Throughout the last few winters, the amount of days above the average winter temperatures have sky-rocketed. Generally the average temperature between December-March are around 25-30 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 to -1C), but the last few years have consisted of many days with 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit (7-10C) and has made many winter activities intolerable.  Currently, this winter has been the driest I‰Ûªve seen. We are in February and we‰Ûªve had only a handful of small storms with most of the snow melting within the next several days afterwards. In reality, New Hampshire is not experiencing a ‰ÛÏwinter‰Ûù in the way it normally does.According to whitehouse.gov: ‰ÛÏIn 2012, power plants and major industrial facilities in New Hampshire emitted more than 4 million metric tons of carbon pollution‰ÛÓthat‰Ûªs equal to the yearly pollution from more than 1 million cars.‰Ûù  This amount of carbon being added to the atmosphere is only adding to the stocks of carbon already there. The key to reversing or stopping the effects of climate change is to cut off the flows from their sources and increase the usage of sinks (such as forests for Carbon sinks) so that stock amount of carbon is reduced.  When President Obama took office, his administration had supported tens of thousands of green-energy projects around the nation. The Obama Administration supported 45 separate energy projects in New Hampshire.  As a result, New Hampshire‰Ûªs renewable energy generation from wind, solar, and geothermal sources has increased by more than 35 percent since 2009. The increase in energy production has produced enough energy to support over 32,000 homes and has brought New Hampshire closer to reaching its own goal of 24.8% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. Over time, the increase in renewable energy production would decrease the amount of energy production from natural gas and other unsafe alternatives. This means that the flow of carbon into the atmosphere would decrease. New Hampshire also aims to protect more of its land, water and wildlife in order to maintain the amount of Carbon fixed and sequestered. As a result of heavy deforestation for agriculture and for timber, the state had lost more than 50% of its forests by the beginning of the 1900s. Thanks to reforestation, New Hampshire is currently 83% forest-land totaling over 163million tons of wood biomass. The state has a very efficient carbon sink.In summation, the climate in New Hampshire is currently being negatively affected from the increase in stock of carbon in the state. Cars, people, power plants and other industrial buildings have been pouring large sums of carbon into the atmosphere and the increase in carbon is effecting the climate cycle here. Over the last century, New Hampshire has had a large reforestation plan and continues to repopulate forests for combatting climate change as part of its climate change action plan, thus increasing the amount of carbon sink that the state has. The best way to decrease the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is to cut off the carbon at its source (by stopping the flow) and to increase the amount of sinks for carbon (forests) in the state in order to decrease the total amount (stock) of carbon. Work Cited:http://www.lcv.org/issues/polling/climate-change-impact-in-new.pdfhttp://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/air/tsb/tps/climate/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/state-reports/NEWHAMPSHIRE_NCA_2014.pdfhttp://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html"

I live at Himeji city in Kansai area. Around here we didn't enough water to grow rice , so people made many artificial ponds. According to a regional history Himeji clan made Kako ouike in 1638. This is the first pond in written history. When I checked the number of ponds, I found Hyougo pre. is the top. (43,321). The second is Hiroshima (20,183)(200km away from Himeji by strech). The third is Kagawa in Shikoku island (14,619).(80 km from Himeji). So that I can say these three are almost same area. My point around climate change is that recently we got a rain in one day so much. I think this is a very document why people who lived in this area made so many ponds.In this area they didn't get enough water to grow rice. So they needed to make artificial ponds. 19,Aug. through 20 Aug. 2016 a warm front was keeping on Japan Sea, warm and moisture air flow into it, air was very unstable in Hiroshima pre. At night it rained 101.0 mm in one hour. 217.0 mm in three hours,257.0 mm in 24 hours.This was the worst report in Hiroshima.This caused big landslide disaster which killed 18 people, serious damage 3 people. Not only people it claimed much on their properties and cars. When I see a graph of average rain fall in Hiroshima, it's 1537.6 mm. They don't have much rain in winter less than 70 mm (Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb.) But during spring and summer each month they have 100-200 mm. So I found 257 mm is the worst document in a day. They have the average of rainfall in a year 1537.6 mm. (1981-2010) Next example is from Kouchi where is next to Kagawa pre. Why I chose here? Because I have a big impression about here.The top of the rainfall list is 867.0 mm in a day. (19,July,2011) The second is 606.5 mm.(5,Aug.2014) This became 1186.0 mm in three days. The third is 674.0 mm (10,Aug. 2014) This became 918.5 mm in three days. That is to say nearly 1 m depth rainfall in three days. Could you believe it? They have average of rainfall 2547.5 mm in a year. (the average of 30 years 1981-2010). Kouchi is the top of the rainfall list in a year. Let's go back to Tame-ike. I found Tame-ike itself become a cause of a disaster when we have such amount of rainfall. And in case of heavy rainfall, it comes with typhoon. Not only typhoon itself become stronger than before, but also heavy rain and strong wind give us a huge damage. When I was child, strong typhoon was about 950-960 hPs. Nowadays we can have a typhoon less than 900hPs. It's incredible for me. I can't image its' strength. Researcher said that because of El Nino. It's one of the famous climate change. El Nino causes everything, researcher says.El Nino and La Nino means more extream weather grobaly. We just know where the events may happen.Because of these, we can say global warming is clear. In the El Nino, sea water become warmer year by year.Then they make much water vapor. Water vapor is the top of greenhouse gases. The energy trapped by water vapor is shown southern to northern latitude, peaking near the equator. Water vapor trap a lot of energy.( 1.8 Fahrenheit means water vapor trap extra 2 watts of energy.) These secondary changes are called climate feedback and they could be more than double the amount of warming caused by carbon dioxside alone. Average residence time of water vapor molecule is 9 days. If greengases concentrations stabilized today,the planet would continue to warm about 0.6'c over next century. Another reason to make sea water warm is maybe because of nuclear power plants.After 2011 Tohoku Disaster all nuclear power plant stopped in Japan.In this time assistant professor checked sea water temperature near the Fukui pre. He found the temperature around them came back normal.  It means sea water became 2'C cooler before the disaster. He said because of 2'C difference made impact on sea creatures and sea plants.

Also droughts, severe alterations in flora processes (early blooming) causing more allergies, failed crops because of ‰ÛÏwrong‰Ûù temperatures, etc. Summers in Madrid are enough warm to easily accept a 2-3å_C temperature rise. Economic example: this winter there has been no snow. It has started to snow one week ago‰Û_in middle February! And this trend has been observed during the last decades, where winter services providers are absolutely desperate. Considering that in Spain we have developed processes and organizational structures to somehow overcome and face these challenges, my question is: how developing countries are supposed to face these issues? We have seen throughout this course that temperature rise not only means warmer environments but many and severe changes in the climate system and socio-economic system.Referred to the article, I guess that future generations will try to solve the specific challenges occurring during their lifespan. Changes will occur relatively slow (long-term) compared with our lifetime. And, sometimes, I would like to think that we are currently generating a different way of thinking, more human-based, questioning our way of life and economic system (which in fact is the main cause of everything, ‰ÛÏeverything for money and power‰Ûù). But sadly, past generations did not care about us, as well as we are not caring at all about future generations. Is this a human curse?? Of course that we are threating millions of present and future human lives (livelihood) through our behaviors and actions, exposing them, for example, to higher temperatures which alter natural cycles. I do not know your opinion mates, but one of the biggest lessons for me during this course is that Earth is perfect, its systems, how it works, how it compensates impacts, how it gets on balance‰Û_we live in the ‰ÛÏknowledge era‰Ûù and it seems that we, as global society, do not want to learn anything. It is shame."

Land warms faster than the ocean surface so warming on land is expected to be 1.4 to 1.7 or so times greater than the average. Next, contrast the scale of warming projected with what occurred over the complete glacial cycle. Typically 5-6 degrees colder than today, global average. And at the depths of the Ice Age cycle Canada, Scandinavia, Northern USA virtually didn't exist. New York was under a kilometer or so of ice. So 'some' degrees of cooling transforms the planet. A similar number of 'some' degrees of warming are likely to have comparable impacts.Speed of change. The 5-6 deg C warming over the glacial cycle (and the from 180 to 280 ppm change in CO2)  occurred over 10-15,000 years. We might see comparable scale changes in less than a century under BAU scenarios! 100 times faster.If we are talking about ecosystems adapting to change, whether primordial forests, ocean systems, wheat fields or the suburban backyard grass 'network', that is an extraordinary speed, perhaps almost unique in the last 500 million years except for the most extreme changes. Ecosystems can adapt if they have time. If they don't have time - phttt! That speed for example is faster than the overturning time of the ocean current systems of around 1000 years. So changes in the ocean will tend to be concentrated in the upper, surface levels because there isn't time for the impacts to be mixed more deeply."

This means that a cooling recovery process in the planet will be unusual for them and even, dangerous, but maybe they will review climatic data just like us, and maybe they will better understand our planet and climate change trends.On the other hand, a 1000 Gton C is the best scenario for the future of humanity because the temperature will not be too high and people will have access to clean technology existent.

My apologies for that. Without  meaning any offence to anyone............1.  Neilchisman's concern for population and cliamte change misses a lot of vital points.  First of all his mention of third-world women, not only here but also in an earlier discussion, is hurtfully 'euro/first-world centric'.  Let me state here that it is the poor in the third-world who have done the least damage to the climate. And the position of those women (whom some of you want to 'teach or preach' about population and re-production) in those poverty stricken patriarchal societies, is pitiable. They do not have a choice on their reproductive-lives.  Instead of focussing on those who are responsible, the call to educate the 'third world women to reproduce less' is just a white-male-supremacist and therefore a very hurtful statement. Please do not look upon 'third world women' as 'producers of 'population'.  In fact, more than the men in their societies, these women are the harbingers of climate protection in more ways than 'sulfur' injection can achieve. It is those women who tramp miles to collect water for the entire household and use it extremely carefully in comparrison to urban house-holds, (they do not use energy consuming piped water), they have no electricity or light in the night. Their days begin with the anouncement of birds of the imminence of sun-rise. Till sun-set they are on the run. They collect fire-wood to cook when their men folk go and cultivate their land. They do not use piped gas (fossil fuel) for cooking either. This list will be un-ending. I should stop here by stating theirs is a need-based society not a consumerist one.2. The other point, i want to raise is the huge, bordering (in my opinion) on the irrational, faith on technology to find solution to climate crisis.  Whether one injects sulfur or does simillar technological feat, it will back fire. Industrial revolution, beside being many other things, was/is a technological phenomenon and lo!!! it has solved many problems(?) and has certainly created more complicated ones. To repeat that will never be wise.3. Aggressive friends will ask me --then what? Well! all of us should think of that. I can only suggest, I do not have a absolute and final answer. Yet I imagine that the climate issue has to be thought of as a social issue. It has come to such a pass because technology reamined in the hands of a few to make profit continuously,(industrialism) both at the cost of society and nature. The in-satiable nature of that profit-making has to be stopped. Everybody's entitlement has to be acknowledged. Human society has to be made of equals. Mahatma Gandhi had said, ""nature has sufficient for everyones NEEDS but not for everyones GREEDS. I am absolutely sure that no solutions can be had with tchnology or even within naitonal boundaries. the entire human society has to be one despite all the differences in language, practice that we have."

This falls far short of the dramatic call to arms that I was expecting; it allows sceptics and lazy thinkers to shrug their shoulders and say ""so what, let others sort it out when the time comes"".  It's not hard to find on the internet more graphic Doomsday descriptions of life at 4 degrees or 6 degrees over pre-industrial  - see for example http://globalwarming.berrens.nl/globalwarming.htm which goes into some detail how there will be widespread war and starvation.  But how do we know whether we can believe such stuff.  For me, I want the science  otherwise it's too easily dismissed as scare mongering.  So, slightly sadly at the end of this excellent course I'm left understanding what the world has to do to stay within 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial, I am convinced it needs doing but when it comes to spreading the word or campaigning politically I don't have the killer argument as to why it absolutely HAS to be done"

If the inflows and outflows to those stocks are equal, then the stock won't change, even if a lot of water is passing through, but you're right that the stock will keep changing if the balance between the flows keeps changing.   You might think about what time scale is of most interest to you.  Is this an issue about an aquifer's stock of water being drawn down over some years?  Is it an issue of groundwater or water in rivers fluctuating on a time scale of days or even hours (e.g. flash floods?).  At what timescale can you find information about the relevant stocks? You're right that the information about the groundwater stock will be limited to available data from people monitoring the groundwater over time, or possibly modeling what's going on in the groundwater, so hopefully you can find information that aligns with the time scale you're interested in. Sara"

Of course there will be a margin for error, but the big picture shows that sea level is going to continue to rise, the temperature is going to get warmer, the change that usually took centuries to unfold is happening in years and decades. Waiting for absolute certainty means you will spend more time reacting and forking out exponentially more money to deal with the negative impacts. Science is giving us a heads up that we can no longer make decisions relying on knowledge and beliefs based in the past but we need to make our society more resilient by examining future changes and adapting faster enough to thrive under the new conditions.That will require a paradigm shift in our thinking and decision making, we need to be planning for the long term, we need to make those decisions now to secure a future for the next generation. However, that requires a lot of money and concessions on the part of decision makers, science can only inform, it's up to us whether we take heed and try to protect our ecosystems, our infrastructure and more importantly the well being of our citizens."

On a heuristic or common sense level, ""very likely"" implies no more than, say, a 60% chance of something occurring.

One of the biggest challenge to me is the gap between the predictions and associated uncertainties done by scientific community and the expectation from decision makers.In your example, a good decision requirse to know precisely when sea level will reach a certain threshold at a given location. This prediction is quite hard to make for scientists!As scientist, one of the most important part of your job is to assess as precisely as possible the uncertainty associated to the prediction or measurement you make. These uncertainties are generally high in climate science. For example, the global average sea level is expected to rise by 0.45 to 0.82 m by 2100 relative to 2000, for a strong CO2 emission scenario (RCP8.5). Depending on the quantity of CO2 we will emit, the plausible range is 0.26 to 0.82m (IPCC AR5, SPM). Although the main conclusion is clear - it will rise - by how much is quite uncertain, and a local prediction is even harder to make!On the other hand, decision makers tend to demand sure fact to make a decision and are reluctant to take any important decision when it is based on a prediction that has some uncertainty.According to you, what is the best way to deal such issue?"

One main impetus that got me started in all this was the observation that the current state of agricultural soils is so poor worldwide, that there is actually more carbon missing from our soils than extra in the atmosphere. So hopefully anything I develop might be able to help mitigate AGW while still producing food for people. So in my scouring of the web for any and all information I could find, I decided this would be a good way to communicate that knowledge to others and try and motivate them to join in the fight. Most of my farmer friends are conservative like me, and I believe the politicians here in Oklahoma are misleading them. Hopefully I will, upon completion of this course, be able to explain to my farmer friends that what's good for the farm and the soil is also good at helping mitigate AGW .  The two can go hand in hand and fixing one can benefit the other which makes everyone happy, including that all important bottom line for the farmer."

The geological record contains a wealth of information about past climate. Framing it in that way would ground what is happening now in what has happened before. I find it useful to also link the scale of human activity to the scales of geological activity - humans are surprisingly powerful, something most people don't realise. A useful approach might be to consider geological processes not in terms of rates per million years or so, but in rates per year. Then contrast that with the scale and rate of human activities. Coal has taken 100's of millions of years to be laid down for example but we are digging it up at rates that would exhaust it in just a few centuries."

But that is countered by the amplifying loop as the temps increase, the rate of decay in most cases also increases, releasing more labile carbon back into the atmosphere as CO2 and methane. These two feedback loops combined should result in something close to net zero in a balanced system. However, I believe our ecosystems generally are not even close to balanced at this time. I am pretty sure that currently the amplifying feedback loops is larger than the stabilizing feedback loop currently. I am also pretty sure we can change that.As far as feedback loops that don't involve climate, I think fire is a perfect example of both. As you start a fire, oxidation releases heat. Heat makes the fire burn faster. A faster burning fire releases even more heat. That makes the fire burn even faster still. This is an example of an amplifying feedback. But later the fire begins to run out of fuel. The more it burns the less fuel there is. The less fuel the smaller the fire. Smaller fires with lower temps  can't oxidize as many compounds as fuel. So there gradually becomes even less fuel available. That means even smaller fires with even less heat that can oxidize even fewer compounds. Eventually the fire goes out because the compounds remaining are too stable to burn any longer."

Total trading volume might go up in a rally, but the amount of sellers and buyers remains the same. In your example the stock doesn't rally because there are more buyers than there are sellers which amplifies the effect, rather it rallies (the effect) because it is undervalued and it is priced according to the new valuation (the cause).Looking forward to your response!Best regards, Pieter"

[http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~jzachos/pubs/Rohling_etal_2012.pdf][1]This is the results from the PaleoSens project. A meta-study bringing together several dozen studies that looked at past climate over deep time. The shortest period was back to the recent Glacial Maximum around 20,000 years and the longest is the entire Phaneozoic Period - the last 420 million years. The study contrasted and reconciled the methods used in the different studies to try and ensure that a consistent conclusion about climate sensitivity (CS) could be drawn from each one. The key result is this diagram:![Paleosens Result][2]This gives the estimate of CS in degrees change per watt/m^2 of forcing change. To convert this to CS per doubling of CO2 we need to multiply these numbers by 3.7 since that is the number of watts/m^2 of forcing per doubling of CO2.John Cook at Skeptical Science recreated this graph based on the CO2 doubling version of CS:![Paleosens as CS][3]The geological record strongly suggests a CS between 2 and 4, with the most likely range between 3.1 and 3.7. We do have an observational basis for testing the value of CS. Its just the observations are from old records.This diagram from the paper is a useful guide to the types of factors that influence the climate and the timescales that they vary over:![Timescales][4]  [1]: http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~jzachos/pubs/Rohling_etal_2012.pdf  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14630409391406256.png  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/146304121095496.jpg  [4]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14630417645988819.png"

So 200/100 is the same as 400/200.Being ignorant of this fact (or deliberately 'misunderstanding' it) is a common component of climate denier claims about how high CO2 concentrations were in the geological past, 100's of millions of years ago. They were concentration in the 1000's of ppm. However you need to think in terms of doublings. 6400 ppm for example is 16 times current levels, but is only 4 doublings.That's why Climate Sensitivity is given relative to doublings of CO2, that is the basic unit of change. CS is then an attempt to estimate how much other factors magnify the impact of CO2 changes."

Each time we double the CO2 concentration, we get the same result (roughly).  200 ppm to 400 does something. 400 to 800 does similar, 800 to 1600 again, and so on.This sort of response is described, mathematically, as logarithmic. In contrast, something that responds linearly would look like:200 ppm to 400 does something400 to 600 does the same,600 to 800 does the same800 to 1000 does the same... etc.And yes, the amplifying feedbacks don't depend on the CO2 concentration. They depend on the consequences of the CO2 concentration. Some CO2 causes some warming. This might change the water vapour content of the air. Or cause more ice to melt, so less sunlight is reflected, or forests shrink to be replaced by deserts which reflect more and evaporate less water.The way to understand feedbacks is to see then as responses to the effects of more CO2, not responses to CO2 itself."

The operational definition of climate adopted by the World Meteorological Organisation (it actually originated with its predecessor, the International Meteorological Organisation before WWII) is that climate is the average of several different weather variables, averaged over 30 years. So climate change is a **change** in that long term average.So an El Nino event isn't a climate change event. A volcanic eruption that only cools the world for a few years isn't a climate change event. An ocean cycle that flips every 10 years isn't climate change.What might be called climate changes would be for example,  - If El Nino events became more frequent, and this persisted for several decades. - A Super Volcano eruption that cooled the earth for many decades.A lot of the supposed criticism of the performance of climate models hinges on expecting them to be skillful at sub-climate time-scales."

Any kind of waste that goes to end up into the bin without using it, is generating more greenhouse emissions.I know it is complicated topic and it has became more complicated here.

The earths surface has to lose the 500 watts/m^2 that it receives to have a stable temperature. Around 20% of this heat loss is due to evaporation and rising warm air. The other 80% is lost through radiation. And a quite famous formula called the [Stefan-Boltzmann Law][1] gives the relationship between the temperature of a surface and how much it radiates. This varies as the 4th power of the temperature given in degrees Kelvin . 0 degrees C is 273.15 K.So for normal environmental temperatures a small change of 1/500th of the total only requires a small temperature change to match it. So over that small range the change is approximately linear. But if we do the same calculation for a much lower temperature a similar change in energy radiated produces a different amount.And the amount of heat loss due to evaporation and thermals would be hugely less.  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"

On Trenberth's diagram at your link, this is the 161 W/m2 ""Absorbed by surface"" from solar input plus the 333 W/m2 ""Absorbed by surface"" from GHGS (it's not exactly 500, but close).  The example for ""in the tropics at noon"" was for the incoming solar radiation you'd receive per m2 at the top of the atmosphere, which would be 1360 W/m2 (the solar constant).  The only reason to use ""in the tropics at noon"" was to have an example in which the Earth's surface was approximately perpendicular to the Sun's incoming radiation.

The estimate that you give is based on the value of 3C/CO2 doubling. But what if you consider the uncertainty on climate sensitivity (1.5 to 4.5 C/CO2 doubling according to the last IPCC report)? Is the observed warming compatible with plausible values for climate sensitivity?Also, a crucial point is that climate sensitivity indicates the temperature difference between 2 climate states at equilibrium. Climate is not instantaneously responding to the CO2 forcing. In particular, feedbacks related to ice sheets or ocean circulation requires decades to thousands of years to operate. To verify how good are estimate of climate sensitivity, we would need to stop emitting CO2 and measure Earth's temperature in, say,  1000 years.Last, there are examples of climate change driven by CO2. Earth experienced ""snowball Earth"" states in the past, ie a near global glaciation. In such a situation, ice reflect most of Sun radiation back to space so that it is a very stable state. The most plausible mechanism to escape snowball Earth state is linked to CO2:, when most of Earth is covered with ice, atmospheric CO2 cannot be consumed anymore by chemical reaction with continental rocks (""chemical weathering""), while volcanoes continue to inject various gases, including CO2, in the atmosphere. As a consequence, atmospheric CO2 levels build up during snowball Earth. Temperature then increases and ice start melting, which decreases Earth's albedo and increase further the temperature (ice-albedo feedback)."

Although it was initially an orbitally forced rise in temperature that then caused a rise in atmospheric CO2, once CO2 concentration rose it then cause still more warming, acting as a feedback rather than as an direct forcing.You go on to state that ""The only example of CO2 driven temperature change is the present time.""This is not true. Although it occurred long before the ice core record of the last 800,000 years, the PETM of 55 mya is an analog where a massive injection of atmospheric carbon over a relatively short time span forced a spike in global mean temperature.You also state that ""With a class-assumed +3 degree increase for doubling CO2, then the CO2 contribution to global warming from CO2 alone since the beginning of the industrial age should be 1.29 degrees C. That's more than observed.""Your statement is confused on two counts:1 - The expected warming for a doubling of CO2 alone (without feedbacks) is ~1.1 to 1.2 C, but we have not yet doubled CO2 from the preindustrial level of ~280 ppmv, so the direct warming to date from CO2 alone must be less that 1.1-1.2 C.2 - The +3 C you cite is the *equilibrium* response after all feedbacks have come into play and run their course. But we are *not* at equilibrium, and not all feedbacks have fully come into play, much less run their course, so a simple proportioning of the 3 C equilibrium response is not justified.Taking these two facts into consideration, it is not at all surprising that we have only seen ~1 C of warming so far."

It's creating a new forcing that didn't exist before. It's different than in the past when natural variability drove all temperature changes. Increasing human CO2 emissions will cause warming.The lesson of the past 800,000 years, if there is one, is that, perhaps, CO2 is not as strong a driver of temperature change in the earth climate system as we think it is. Unidentified stabilizing forcings prevented it from becoming the primary driver of temperature change in the past and could do so in the present, too. "

That is, the tail is wagging the dog.The video's reasoning would be perfectly valid if CO2 change were the only temperature feedback involved. That, unfortunately, is a vast oversimplification. There are all kinds of feedbacks besides CO2 acting on temperature. For example, CO2 warming increasing water vapor which also increases thick clouds that is a strong stabilizing temperature feedback that increases albedo which, in turn, lowers earth's temperature; which, in turn, causes earth's oceans to absorb more CO2 that reduces CO2's warming effect. Throw in a increases in aerosol and particulate feedbacks and the next thing you know you have snowball earth. ;)The number of feedback possibilities from thousands of variables, both warming and cooling, are almost limitless."

Indeed, I actually have a question about how I might have done a better job.In my essay I wrote about Hurricane Sandy, which hit NYC in 2012, and the storm surge that flooded lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. My thesis was that although we cannot be certain right now about the relationship between climate change and hurricanes, we can be certain that the recorded sea level rise around New York City in 2012 (due to the ocean water's thermal expansion and the melting of the cryosphere caused by rising global temperatures) made the storm surge that flooded the city worse. My question is: would the volume of ocean water surrounding NYC in a particular area during the time before the hurricane be the stock? And would the water pushed by Sandy's winds into that water, expanding its area for the duration of the storm, be the flow?Thank you in advance for this personal feedback!! Genevieve"

One would be the stock of ocean water covering land (land that is usually above sea level, or above high tide), since that's the out-of-the-ordinary part of the story.  That stock would go from zero to something-greater-than-zero during the storm surge, back to zero again, and the flow would be as you describe - energy from the wind forcing the water ashore, then flow back to the ocean.  I find it a little more challenging to think about the stock of water surrounding NYC over time, but you'd expect that also to increase during the storm surge. Or, it sounds like you made a point about higher sea levels exacerbating the problem of storm surge, in which case, as you describe, the stock would be the water in the ocean, increasing sea level over time with thermal expansion and land ice melt. This seems like a good incorporation of relevant stocks and flows into your essay. It sounds to me like you might have done a better job with stocks and flows than you might think!Sara"

I'd expect you'd score those essays low (e.g. 0) in the ""Technicalities"" part of the rubric. If someone didn't read (or didn't understand) the assignment instructions about referencing, then they might legitimately write an essay that's stellar in most of the categories on the rubric, but poor in the Technicalities.  In that case, you wouldn't be able to tell if it was written in their own words, unless you do a quick internet search on a phrase or two.  If someone is struggling with writing an essay (because they haven't done it before, or haven't done it in a long time), and also doesn't reference appropriately, then it's likely they'd score low in several categories on the rubric.  The main challenge in an open, online, global setting is that different cultures do have different expectations regarding writing in one's own words.  For some, it's a sign of respect to use others' words.  In most academic cultures (as you know), people are expected to write in their own words and reference ideas and information gleaned from others, but that might be unfamiliar to some participants.  A second consideration is emphasis.  My primary goal is for people in this course to investigate and share what's going on in their area, for everyone's benefit.  The essay-writing practice and guidelines might (I hope will) help people with their writing and referencing.  If it does, that's good, but secondary to the main goal in this setting.My bottom line advice would be to mark it according to the rubric so that people are marked as consistently as can be done.  Feel free to provide written feedback to the writers about using their own words, quoting correctly, referencing correctly.  That might help them understand expectations and help them with their next essay (or similar in the future).  I'm happy to hear suggestions about the rubric too - feel free to send feedback my way.Sara"

So, yes, as you said, focus on a source (or sink) of carbon/carbon dioxide near you.  (Assignment 1 was about a climate change impact in your area, which might or might not have involved carbon).  There are some nice examples already posted on the Carbon and Climate map, which might help you think about it.  There's one about the role of salt marshes as a carbon sink; another about the release of carbon to the atmosphere from forest fires; another about carbon capture and storage - browsing the map might help, and think about what's going on near you that either adds to carbon emissions, or acts as a carbon sink.In my area, for example, I could imagine writing about the provincial government's plan to build a liquefied natural gas industry and the consequences for British Columbia's carbon emissions.  Or I could write about issues around a carbon offsets project, or about the efforts of a town or campus aiming to achieve ""carbon-neutral"" operations.  If I lived in the north (in Canada), maybe I'd write about the carbon flows from permafrost to the atmosphere.  Or I could write about carbon emissions associated with using captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery.  These are just some examples - hope it helps you to find a topic near you.Sara"

The numbers of animals then would be dependant on the carrying capacity of that restored prairie.  In other words, converting cornfields back into prairie. Manage it correctly and yes, livestock numbers could and would increase. Manage it incorrectly and numbers of livestock would decrease.Most people forget this, because it is counter intuitive, but overgrazed land supports fewer animals than land properly managed. So when you go see a small number of skinny animals, that land is overgrazed, and those animals need supplemental grain to fatten. But right next door immediately adjacent, there might be 2-4 times as many animals/acre, all fat, and that land is NOT overgrazed. The interesting thing when you look at the side effects as it relates to global warming, is that 2-4 times as many animals on properly managed land actually sequesters many many many times more carbon in the liquid carbon pathway too. But you do this by managing the grass. That's the key. Most people who do this actually prefer to be called grass farmers or crop farmers where the crop is the grass, and the animals are the secondary tool for harvesting the grass. The reason why is to get their priorities right in their head. A few like me take it even one step further and call themselves carbon farmers, indicating the even greater priority. In my case I don't even raise animals on my research plots. I raise annual vegetables, but plant them in the prairie without killing the prairie. The disadvantage of my work is that I must simulate grazing with mowing. Not as good as a cow, but better than a plow. My test plots are currently too small to use actual livestock, but a full sized farmer could do both a crop and grazing. The key of course is the symbiosis between the grasses and the soil food web.Probably though the main source for your confusion is in not understanding that although technically corn is a grass, it in no way functions like a prairie ecosystem, and approximately 97% +/- of all animals raised in this country are at least finished in feedlots or confinement barns, chicken houses etc... many spend their entire lives in these concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) and are fed corn and soy mostly. Every wild ecosystem on the planet has both animals and biodiverse plants living in it. But in agriculture today, the animals are removed and the plants are monocrops. Very highly inefficient and destructive to the environment and soil and in fact a large source of carbon emissions. So what you were reading is correct.....the way we do things NOW. But it would be the exact opposite if those animals were returned to the land.""Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted & thoughtful observation rather than protracted & thoughtless labor; & of looking at plants & animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single-product system.""

Seems to me that injecting SO2 will cause acid rain when the aerosols wash out of the atmosphere. That could kill land plants and molluscs and planktonic organisms which have calcium carbonate shells.. When all of the dust clouds and aerosols wash out of the atmosphere, the excess carbon dioxide will still remain and the warming could proceed again without any mitigating effects. Not to mention the worst effect, blocked out sunlight disrupts photosynthesis both on land and in the photic zone of the ocean, causing food chains to collapse potentially.

But I strongly disagree when ""geoengineering"" is referring to restoring ecosystem function over 40% of the land surface of the planet. We know for a fact that we as a species caused the collapse of ecosystem function, and therefore it is our responsibility as stewards of the land to do everything humanly possible to restore those ecosystem services to the best of our ability. See in my mind and my POV, rising CO2 in the atmosphere is a symptom of ecosystem collapse world wide. Viewing it as a symptom instead of a cause of your problems opens up many possibilities for mitigation overlooked by the ""mechanistic"" geoengineering crowd. It is fundamentally a biological problem, and requires a biological solution. Taking a mechanistic approach is what got us in the position in the first place, IMHO.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1209_051209_crops_map.htmlhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/Remember the analogy in the course where you are filling a tub with a drain and both the inputs and outputs are in balance and the level stays pretty steady? You can increase the input of water and the tub will start filling up, but higher pressure from more water makes the drain increase as well. Eventually it levels off at a steady level again, but a bit higher. However, block the drain, and even a very small input will overflow the tub. Well the ecosystem service missing is CO2 sequestration into the soil. It is the ""drain"", and fossil fuels are the faucet in this analogy. We BOTH blocked the drain AND turned up the faucet a little. At this point, even a tiny flow from the faucet will still overflow the tub, because the drain is blocked. Any plumber knows you must first try and shut off the water if you can, but you haven't fixed anything until you unclog that drain! Once the drain is flowing, minor adjustments to the faucet to prevent overflow is fine, but without a drain it can never truly be fixed or adjusted properly! This analogy is a good parallel to AGW where water symbolises CO2, the drain is our soils, and the faucet is fossil fuels. We must fix that drain or we don't eat. So the priority in this case is to restore ecosystem function to our agricultural soils worldwide, once that is done, then we will have a much better idea exactly how much emissions really need to drop. Remember it is the net of the entire system, not emissions alone, that matters.> ""The first duty of the agriculturalist must always be to understand that he is part of nature and can not escape from his environment."" - Sir Albert Howard"

And research in the last few years strongly suggests that the hole in the Antarctic is having a noticeable climate impact. With more energy reaching the surface near the pole, this appears to be increasing the strength of the circum-polar winds, counter-intuitively having a cooling effect on the Antarctic by preventing weather systems from lower latitudes reaching the continent - the decline in heat transport from low latitudes outweighing the increase in heat from more UV."

The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living organism on Earth, which is around 2300 kilometers in length, with a mass roughly half the size of Texas. There are over 1500 species of fish dependent on the Reef, which also brings over two million tourists to the area equating to around AU$5-6 Billion per year in revenue. (greatbarrierreef.org)Coral Reefs are formed in warm waters where coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate skeletons from the underside of their skin and can grow at a rate between 5 and 25mm per year. The reefs prefer consistent temperatures, shallow water and lots of sunlight to filter through to their symbiotic algae. (Coral Reef Alliance)The greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change, which is happening at a rapid rate and is producing potentially irreversible damage to the ecosystem. An aerial study (fig.1) of the entire reef found that in the northern sector of Reef 81% of the 522 reefs surveyed were severely bleached with less than 1% not bleached.The main contributing factor to coral bleaching is rising sea temperatures caused by global warming. Global warming caused by human activities that emit heat-trapping carbon dioxide has raised the average global temperature by about 0.6å¡C. (Ocean.nationalgeographic.com)When exposed to unnaturally hot waters, the corals expel their zooxanthellae as a stress response to extreme thermal conditions. This response causes the coral to lose its vibrant colour and become bleached. The main problem with the human impact on this ecosystem is that coral has a natural cycle whereby it can respond to the bleaching events, however when accelerated breaches the ability to recover. The water temperature increases take days to bleach the coral, which then takes weeks or months to recover. If the temperature is prolonged, the stresses on the coral will force the reef to eject the symbiotic algae and the coral will be irreparable.The second impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef is ocean acidification. The hard corals are produced through calcification of limestone or calcium carbonate. This process is slowed when ocean waters become more acidic. Naturally Reefs are continually worn down by storms, and creatures that eat, burrow or dissolve their way through limestone. (gbrmpa.gov.au) If the rate of calcification slows due to the acidification of the water the rate of growth to destruction will be in deficit and the reef will lead to coral loss.The effects of human induced climate change are producing irreparable damage to this ecosystem at a faster rate than can naturally be endured by the Reef. This is leading to the mass destruction of the coral beds, which in turn will affect the sea life, which relies on the habitat to survive. Alongside the natural impacts this degradation will have a negative effect on the tourism industry of the area and will impact the economic growth of the area. These wide ranging issues stem from global warming inextricably linked to human-activity and need to be mitigated to limit the effects on such a delicate infrastructure.Sources(greatbarrierreef.org)http://www.greatbarrierreef.org/about-the-reef/great-barrier-reef-facts/(Coral Reef Alliance)http://coral.org/coral-reefs-101/coral-reef-ecology/how-coral-reefs-grow/(Ocean.nationalgeographic.com)http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/explore/pristine-seas/critical-issues-sea-temperature-rise/(gbrmpa.gov.au)http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/managing-the-reef/threats-to-the-reef/climate-change/what-does-this-mean-for-habitats/coral-reefs![fig1][1]![fig2][2]  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1464151482120594.jpg  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14641515051435342.jpg"

Along with these aspects the city also shows changes in social indices as increased poverty, greater dispersal of diseases such as flu, fever, (diseases caused by mosquito transmission) and those derived from air pollution.Colombia, is located in the extreme north of South America and borders with Panama to the north, the east by Venezuela and Brazil and south by Ecuador and Peru. The city of Bogota is located at 2600 above the sea, in the Mountainous System of Los Andes and has 9'300 331 inhabitants (DANE, 2016) in the metropolitan area.One of the biggest problems facing this city, is to resolve the issue of road mobility, since overpopulation is leading to highways and streets are not sufficient for the large number of cars. That is why for 15 years, the ""mass transit system"" or ""Transmilienio"" covering the whole city was created (public service buses for 160 people (TRANSMILENIO, 2016)); however, the system worked for the first few years of operation, as the population grew exponentially in Bogota. Therefore this system did not work to mitigate this problem and even more when the rate of purchase of cars in Bogota exceeds the capacity of the road.Now, the questions are: What is the influence of the large number of cars and buses in the emission of greenhouse gases? What are the possible mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce CO2 emissions by burning fossil fuels?During 2010 and 2012, they were released into the air 16,279,278 tons of CO2 (Municipality of Bogota, 2014) due to burning of fossil fuels in the road transport sector. This sector being the main contributor to GHGs in Bogota. As a result of these emissions are mainly estimated for the city, temperature increases between 1.7 to 6.0 å¡ C  is foreseen, changes in rainfall patterns between - 22% to 25%, decrease in water aquifers and loss of biological biodiversity. Also Flash floods on the banks of the BogotÌÁ River and its tributaries, increased frequency of windstorms, forest fires, more frequent thunderstorms, more frequent extreme events such as frost, increased frequency of heat waves and drought and is estimated increased ultraviolet (SECRETARIA DE AMBIENTE, 2016).I personally believe that the solutions to this problem as complex must rely heavily on the mayoral Bogota, but also of each resident in the city. Scientifically it is proven that the emissions of greenhouse gases has increased average levels of temperature and consequent strengthening the effect of climate change.Politically must find measures and solutions to strengthen the mass transit system in Bogota and discourage car use, where possible. Likewise, should encourage citizens to use other means of alternative mobility such as bicycles, electric bikes, scooters and skateboards. Changing the mindset of citizens should be another important aspect, since changing habits of mobility means reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.Currently in Bogota, a small part of the population, but at the same time representative, this being an example of environmental awareness and has opted to change the typical form of transport (bus or car) to mobilize Bike. However, new problems arise, for example: Due to the high rate of air pollution, some people are causing respiratory problems and lack of infrastructure in some areas in BogotÌÁ, there is not adequate space for mobilization by bike.Finally, I would like to say that the way to find a friendly Bogota to the environment is long but not impossible. In addition there are many aspects of political, social, developmental and planning type needs to be improved to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Likewise the strengthening of alternative forms of mobility should be a priority for the city of Bogota.SOURCES1)DANE, 2016 Departamento nacional de planeacion .

I do believe it has a few holes though. Like most climate scientists, Ruddiman focuses on deforestation for agriculture, yet historically all agriculture starts first in the plains/grasslands/savannas/meadows and only turns to deforestation after the grasslands get used up. That's why all our main staple crops like corn wheat rice barley etc are all grasses.Deforestation as a result of expanding agriculture is a relatively new phenomenon mostly because the vast majority of productive grasslands are already gone.I also did not like this presentation and commentary on Ruddiman. There is a greater effect than presented. If you go back to the video and look at how the commentary discusses the ""slower"" rise that Ruddiman describes, you should count that rise against the projected drop. The two added together are significantly larger. I believe this is a systemic bias in climate science. The only reason it aggravates me is that it creates a ""blind spot""  that hides potential mitigation strategies."

Our assumption, and our imaginations, might lead us to envisage just human used tools as the implements. But what else might have been used, intentionally or inadvertently? Some possible suggestions: - Fire-Stick farming. Intentional burning of landscapes to produce desired food supply outcomes. Aboriginal Australians have been doing that for much more than 8000 years. - Domestication of animals allowing increased tillage, changing ecosystems with many knock-on effects. - Hunting of megafauna and peak predator species, hugely changing species mix, foraging patterns, soil fertilization patterns etc. - Grazing domestic animals on the new growth, seeds and nuts of existing forests, vegetation etc, changing survival rates and germination rates for different plant species in an ecosystem, changing the vegetation mix. Imagine what one might do to an Oak forest over centuries if you run your pigs there every year when the acorns fall.Now imagine how these types of factors might interact with each other. How might they change the mix of pollinator species, population numbers for 'keystone' species etc. Our more modern observations show what can happen when something disrupts a key part of an ecosystem - killing wolves lets elk numbers grow killing young trees and devastating beaver populations leading to increased stream erosion; DDT kills sea otters leading to explosions in sea urchin numbers and decimation of kelp forests.Natural ecosystems seem to be a complex mix of great robustness and great fragility, all depends which part of them is disrupted. Our ancient ancestors undoubtedly had a keen eye and insight into how they could modify their environment to feed their children. That doesn't mean they could understand all the consequences of every action they took."

Of course there was some deforestation done by man early on, but I highly suspect the larger influence was prior to that when the megafauna herds (mammoths, mastodons, wooly rhinoceros and various herbivores and their predators like saber tooth cats, short faced bears, cave bears  etc etc etc...) were exterminated.The megafauna extinctions would change wet grasslands/savannas to forest and dry grasslands/savannas to desert. That would be the first change, then with the giant herds gone, man would switch to more agriculture to replace that lost food source. So you actually have the ironic thing happening in some cases where grassland turns to forest after the megafauna extinctions, then deforested by man after! Since these things all happened at different times as man migrated to different continents, muddling through the paleo record to find the CO2 signatures that match will be difficult. Ruddiman I believe is definitely on the right track, but as I mentioned before probably missing that important gap. I say important because the influence of grasslands on climate, particularly in CO2 sequestration and cooling, was not well understood until very very recently. Research is ongoing and still much more to learn, but the field is exploding at enormous rate. Most climate models  and research by focusing on forests instead of grasslands/savannas are missing an important mitigation tool IMHO. As the Ruddiman early hypothesis gains acceptance, and it has, I believe this other aspect will gain traction too.Now on an island like Hawaii, or Easter island etc... that is a special case. Those areas probably were almost completely forest before impact by man. So I agree with you there."

I should have been able to spot that myself.The reason for asking the question is because I'm puzzle over the difference between the results from the ERBE period of Feb 1985 to Apr 1989 and the results from the CERES period of Mar 2000 to May 2004.The ERBE period, published by the IPCC in 2007, shows earth's inflows/outflows balance both at the TOA and at the surface. The CERES period shows the 0.9 W/m2 imbalance in both.That's puzzling to me because in the CERES period earth's temperature was flat while sunspot activity decreased TSI by about 0.5W/m2, yet a positive imbalance was still found. Obviously there are many other forcings that come into play, but those two stand out in my mind related to the narrow ranges of the two datasets.The ERBE data, on the other hand, was collected when both temperature and TSI were increasing. TSI increased by about 1 W/m2, yet no imbalance was detected. It seems the imbalance should have been easily detected in the earlier data, but was not. "

For example, the beginning of the 1985-1989 period was still under the influence of the El Chichon eruption. Another example: the cloud cover over the tropical Pacific depends on the ENSO phase, and again impacts the radiative balance. So to me, differences in radiative balance assessed over such short periods are not surprising: you don't expect it to be constant over time. Note however a robust feature: whatever is the chosen period/dataset used, you get a positive imbalance."

Batteries, plug in charging, inductive charging in the highways. Articulated trucks might offer other options. The trailer that carries the cargo might have batteries slung beneath it -there is often lots of space down there to provide clearance for the turntable. The prime mover can decouple from one trailer and couple up to another with charged batteries. Then while the previous trailer is being unloaded and reloaded, it can also be getting charged.Rail has two options to replace fossil fuels. Overhead power lines, or in those situations where overhead lines are too expensive - long distance but low volume rail lines such as Sydney to Perth, then an old fashioned idea can make a return. Just like in the days of steam when there was a carriage behind the loco that carried the fuel - coal or wood -electric loco's could add several battery cars to the rest of their load. If you are pulling 100 wagons, adding 1,2,3 battery cars isn't a great impost.Part of the issue with thinking about transport fuels is we tend to think in terms of current paradigms and assume we simply have to replace the current modes with replacements that work the same way. What if we convert a lot of air transport to airships? They supply their own buoyancy so need much less power but the cost is a 1 hour trip may now take 4-8 hours. But you don't need long runways for them to land. How much shipping can be replaced with long distance rail. A few strategic tunnels and we could do rail freight from Tokyo to Dublin or Capetown, Anchorage to Buenos Aires. Ships may be more efficient at present, but if we are decarbonising, how does that efficiency change?"

Every added kilo of batteries will be a kilo of freight not hauled. And dropping loaded trailers for charging while en route will simply delay delivery. Both will be totally unacceptable for transport companies and shippers/consignees alike, not to mention consumers when higher freight charges are added to prices. I repeat: with semi-trailers and other heavy transport modes batteries simply are not energy dense enough to move the mass the distances required. And that includes rail. Electrified overhead works just fine, assuming the electricity is generated by non-carbon renewables. It's currently widely used in Europe, but electrified trackage in North America has actually declined.Airships make sense, as long as speed is not required, but then slow speed air travel is kind of an oxymoron."

The climate models are using inputs for agricultural methods at minimum 30 years out of date, and in some cases agricultural methods thousands of years out of date.If we are locked into the current industrialised agricultural models and rangeland management and/or subsistence agricultural models, yes nearly an impossible task to model a world that stays below 1.5å¡C warmer than pre-industrial...maybe nearly impossible to keep it below  2.0å¡C warmer. But change that management on what is by far the majority of the earth's productive land, and it becomes far easier. But that option isn't even in the model! No wonder it is so difficult for people advocating such a change to find any traction!For example, just to get a rough estimate of scale: A pretty average case study of a no till method called pasture cropping done by Dr. Christine Jones in Australia found a 10 year average of 17.1 tonnes/hectare on long term sequestered CO2  into the soil. (A-horizon, not O-horizon) There are approximately 1.5 gigahectares of arable land currently in the world that is currently on average actually an emissions source rather than a sink. So do the math:17.1 tons/hectare/year X 1.5 gigahectares = 25.65 gigatonnes CO2/ year potential sink just on arable land already in crop production. The total emissions from fossil fuels and cement are approximately around 36 gigatonnes CO2/year, of which approximately 50%+/- is already entering natural sinks like the ocean and natural ecosystems, weathering etc....So do the math 36 Gt CO2 X .5 = 18Gt CO2 /year net emissions.18Gt CO2 /year - 25.65 Gt CO2/ year = -7.65 Gt CO2/year netAnd that's just arable land. The world area of Pasture and Fodder Crops is another 3.5 gigahectares and another even larger area of desertified/desertifying rangeland. The scale is enormous, far larger than fossil fuel emissions. So anyone serious about mitigating human caused global warming, but ignores agriculture, is fooling themselves IMHO. At least put it in the models, so one can see the potential effect agriculture could have as methods gradually change. If it was in the models, we could adjust the time it takes to convert from our antiquated current methods of production, to more modern climate, soil and ecosystem friendly methods of production, and get an idea of time needed for the conversion thus giving policy makers something to work with. Might even get to model how amplifying and stabilizing feedbacks effect things in a dropping atmospheric CO2 scenario."

Two reference periods used often in climate science for temperature anomalies are ""pre-industrial"" (and you'd have to look to see what time period someone is actually using to represent ""pre-industrial""), and you'll often see temperature anomalies using a baseline of 1951-1980, which is a relatively flat period in the 20th century temperature record and therefore a pretty nice period of time to choose as a baseline. Are you thinking about how anomalies are actually calculated using a baseline?Sara  "

I was looking at a critique of an article which compared Hansen‰Ûªs 1988 predictions to actual temperature by the ‰Û÷Global Warming Policy Foundation‰Ûª in order to try and explain what I was asking. As part of their explanation they used an example of NASA GISS temperature to HadCRUT3 temperature plotted on the same graph which showed the HadCRUT3 temperatures consistently lower than the NASA temperatures. The explanation was they were based on different baselines. I didn‰Ûªt understand how that worked but after looking at it in more detail I see the difference is because the zero point is not the same for the two. Don‰Ûªt know why I didn‰Ûªt see that right off the bat. Anyway thanks again for the reply but think I understand what I was asking now.

With the right infrastructure, half of all electricity in southern and eastern Africa could come from clean, cost-effective renewables by 2030. We would then see a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Now let‰Ûªs examine some of these renewable sources in more detail.  Solar energy. This is simply the light and heat that comes from the sun. It is the most abundant energy resource on Earth. The amount of solar striking the Earth each day is more than 10,000 times the world‰Ûªs total energy use!       There are two common ways to convert solar energy into electricity: photovoltaic and solarthermal technologies.  When sunlight hits photovoltaic cells made of silicon or other materials, a chemical reaction occurs. This results in the release of electricity. These cells can then be packaged together to make solar panels. And solar-thermal technologies concentrate the sun‰Ûªs rays with mirrors to heat a liquid and create steam. This steam is then used to power a generator and create electricity.  The wind, like the sun, is also a clean and renewable energy source. For thousands of years, people have used windmills to grind grain and pump water. Today, modern machines called wind turbines are used to make electricity. To produce electricity on a large scale, many wind turbines can be placed together on wind farms. And this is catching on: Wind power has been the fastest-growing energy source in the world since 1990.  And finally, the energy inherent in water and steam can also produce electricity. If you‰Ûªve ever stood in a fast‰ÛÒmoving stream, under a waterfall, or on the ocean shore as waves come crashing in, then you‰Ûªve felt the power of moving water. Now this power is captured through hydroelectric power plants, which force flowing water through wheels or rotors known as turbines, and that produces energy.  Another source of energy is the heat built up inside the Earth itself. Now if you dig a deep hole straight down into the Earth and you encounter what is known as geothermal energy. At geothermal power plants, wells are drilled 1 to 3 kilometers into the Earth to pump steam or hot water to the surface to make energy.  Now these renewable sources are not only exciting, but they offer tremendous potential for Africa. Think about it. Our continent contains bountiful solar and wind resources and some of the world‰Ûªs largest hydropower and geothermal resources. Much of this energy is untapped. And the World Bank estimates that only 7 to 8 percent of Africa‰Ûªs hydropower potential is currently utilized.  The good news is that many African countries are starting efforts to use these clean and renewable resources. Kenya was the first African nation to begin drilling for geothermal power. In other countries like South Africa, wind farms are beginning to produce energy. But we have only begun to unlock the potential of our continent‰Ûªs clean, renewable resources which Nigeria is not lacking behind .There is so much more to be done to ensure that our generation and future generations can benefit from this clean energy. I urge each of you to get involved and join this environmental movement, which is so important for all of in Nigeria and our beloved continent, Africa.  "

So a rise from 100 to 200 parts per million will lead to a rise in temperature of 3 degrees, and a rise of 200 to 400 parts per million will lead to another 3 degrees in warming.My question is: why wouldn't the doubling from 200 to 400 parts per million lead to a greater than 3 degree rise in warming, since that doubling increases the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to a greater degree than the doubling from 100 to 200 that also leads to a 3 degree rise in warming? Another issue I don't understand: wouldn't there be positive feedback loops in going from 200 to 400 that weren't present during the doubling from 100 to 200? What am I missing here? Thank you!"

I am certainly not a fan of ex-President Bush but on the other hand I had read the very compressive report published by my engineering society that provided detailed information regarding the collapse and the details behind why it occurred. Since it was in my area of expertise I was able to counter every argument he presented very well. Even before this debate I was always inclined to accept the opinions of experts in their field of expertise, however the debate illuminated to me how miss-information can be used to influence and confuse those who do not have expertise in a subject that can be very complicated.

Here climate change means flood or drought, little else. Our state is probably best known for being dead center of the ""dust bowl"" of the 1930s. We are also right in the middle of ""tornado alley"", right behind our neighbor Kansas in frequency and severity of supercell storms and tornados. Safe to say that ""Sooners"" as we are called are quite accustomed to severe weather events.  The question for Oklahoma is how global warming and climate change effects our already extreme weather and maybe just as importantly our groundwater supplies.According to the National Climate Assessment the last drought that just ended last year was both hotter and drier for Oklahoma than a similar period of the 1930s Dust Bowl. In 2012 we set the all time record for number of days over 100 degrees in a single year. And what about floods? May 2015 set the record in recorded history for the wettest month in Oklahoma. Most of this rainfall occurring as part of supercell storms producing damaging EF5 tornados, hail and flooding. So it seems our already extreme weather is getting even more extreme.Sounds bad right? Well it might even be worse than it seems. To understand why we need to look at the water cycle and aquifer stocks and flows. Our aquifer basins are in a constant state of flux as inflow from groundwater seepage can fill them and we pump out water for human and agricultural uses. The largest aquifer in Oklahoma, the Ogallala is down 150 feet from historic levels. Some of the shallower aquifers are up a small amount, being somewhat replenished by these heavy rainfall events. However, taking all the aquifers into consideration the net flux overall is down. More is being pumped from the wells than is being replaced by groundwater seepage.Since both usage (outflow) and climate (inflow) are controlling factors  to aquifer levels (stocks), let's look at how climate change is affecting these fluxes, which in turn affects the basin total stocks of water. So how does climate change to global warming affect the water cycle of Oklahoma? Droughts are pretty straight forward. Less water seepage into the aquifers and more farmers pumping larger amounts out of the ground to irrigate fields. Maybe less known is the effect severe storms has. Even though a lot of water falls as rain, it is less effective than gradual rainfall over a longer period of time. Less soaks into the ground and more runs off and creates floods. Also since this happens in a short time frame, before the water can soak far, the sun is back out causing evaporation.I believe this increased variability to extremes, hotter drier droughts and more severe storms, is primarily why overall our groundwater stocks are dropping. Less and less water is infiltrating to replenish  our already overburdened aquifers. Climate change is already affecting us in Oklahoma in many ways, and trend is only getting worse."

Not to mention the intensity of storms has resulted in storm surges and costal flooding cutting off communities and destroying roadways and undermining houses. The issue of water scarcity has become much more prominent since the rainfall averages over the last 30 years appear to show a decline in combination with saltwater intrusion of our aquifers and the increase in evaporation because of the warmer days. Moreover the cumulative effect of lower than normal rainfall averages over successive years during the rain season has made water security a major issue.Figuring out what impacts can be attributed to climate change and what is normal variability is a serious issue not to mention. The lack of consideration for DRR and CC in our policies, plans and projects hinders the goal of promoting sustainable development making our country very susceptible to small to moderate changes in climate."

The ""top of atmosphere"" temperature I refer to in the video for 3.1 would be more accurately called the ""effective radiating temperature"" for Earth.  That is, the blackbody temperature at which the planet radiates enough energy back to space to balance the incoming solar energy (minus reflection).  That temperature is about 255K.  The video exercise is simplified, and I chose to have people start with the blackbody peak wavelength for practice with Wein's Law.  Dealing with planetary emission is complicated because infrared emission comes from many different altitudes, not just the altitude at which the atmosphere is about 255K (which is about 5 km, though varies with location). So the photons you'd measure using a satellite are originating from lots of different places - some are coming directly from Earth's surface, others are coming from air molecules very close to the satellite, and everything in between. If you want to explore what the spectrum coming from Earth measured by satellite looks like, plus the resulting temperature profile with altitude (variations on the figure you posted), I'd suggest using David Archer's freely available interactive Modtran program here: [http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/modtran/][1] You can modify greenhouse gas concentrations, look at differences in the atmosphere at different latitudes, put in clouds, and see both how the outgoing emissions spectrum changes and how the temperature changes with height.  Thanks for the feedback,Sara  [1]: http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/modtran/"

Temperature change is the cause. CO2 change is the effect.""This is perhaps a simplified perspective. Consider that it might actually be a bit of a false dichotomy. Rather perhaps something initiates temperature changes, other than CO2, thus causing some release of CO2 and other changes such as changes in snow and ice cover, methane levels. These all in turn cause further temperature changes and further effects. That the climate system has multiple drivers, CO2 being one of them, which can change as a consequence of temperature change, and can also then cause temperature change. This is the basic concept of feedbacks. But some factors might be able to act as both driver and feedback, while some are restricted to just being feedbacks.Snow and ice cover for example can't easily change except as a feedback. CO2 levels however **can** change without an initial temperature change. Truly huge volcanic events - not just a normal eruption - can significantly change CO2 levels. And humans digging fossil carbon materials up and burning them can change CO2 levels without an initial temperature change trigger.So what the ice core record should show us is CO2 playing the role we expect, in that **particular context**, as a feedback. And deep time paleo-climate, looking back 100's of millions of years, shows events where very large changes in CO2 levels occurred as a result of periods of huge volcanic activity and very large temperature changes (and other disruption) occurred as a result. And today another large disruption is occurring, not triggered by temperature change, but analogous to those past volcanic eras. Humanity burning fossil fuels is like a vast volcanic eruption. Any line of evidence needs to be evaluated wrt whether it shows CO2 having the role we expect it to have, **in that context**."

There are many reasons this won‰Ûªt work, but the basic one is that planting trees increases stocks, but doesn‰Ûªt stabilize fluxes. Using the bucket analogy, you have a created a bigger bucket, but still a bucket with no drain. It helps temporarily ‰Û_ until the new bigger bucket gets full. We call that Saturation. It‰Ûªs a temporary fix that helps, but it is not a long term solution.However, maybe even accidently, Dyson might have stumbled onto something that can solve AGW to the benefit of all.Atmospheric CO2 level is the primary human impact we can change that directly influences energy flows. It comes down to the carbon cycle and the CO2 fertilization effect. Dyson is correct BTW that there is more carbon in the soil than in biomass and atmosphere combined. Also correct about the fertilization effect on plant growth. This is what is called a stabilizing feedback. The debunkers of Dyson are also correct about the increasing emissions from the labile fraction of soil carbon as temperature increases. Called a reinforcing feedback.Here is where it gets interesting. Dyson AND the vast majority of the Dyson debunking sources have focused on the wrong biome. It is NOT the forest plants that have the capability to mitigate AGW. It‰Ûªs the grassland/savanna biome that actually can be a forcing for global cooling, and counter the current global warming trend.In a forest, the stabilizing feedbacks and the reinforcing feedbacks largely counter each other, and little is done long term to mitigate rising CO2 levels. Once you reach that saturation point you are done. You might even decrease albedo. But grasslands sequester carbon very differently than forests. Most grassland carbon is not sequestered in biomass, nor labile carbon in the top O horizon of the soil, but rather the newly discovered liquid carbon pathway. Grasslands also have higher albedo.Most terrestrial biosphere carbon storage is in grassland (mollic) soils. Where trees store most their products of photosynthesis in woody biomass, grasslands instead of producing a woody tree truck, secrete excess products of photosynthesis (exudates) to feed the soil food web, especially mycorrhizal fungi. Those fungi (AMF) in turn secrete a newly discovered compound called glomalin deep in the soil profile. Glomalin itself has a 1/2 life of 7‰ÛÒ42 years if left undisturbed. The deepest deposits even longer with a 1/2 life of 300 years or more in the right conditions. Then when it does degrade a large % forms humic polymers that tightly bind to the soil mineral substrate and can last thousands of years undisturbed. Together they all form what is called a mollic epipedon. That‰Ûªs your really good deep fertile soils of the world and they contain far more carbon, even in their highly degraded state currently, than all the terrestrial biomass and atmospheric CO2 put together. This LCP is what built those famously deep and fertile midwest soils.Even though wood is resistant to decay, the biomass of forests is still considered part of the active carbon cycle (labile carbon) That litter layer on the forest floor is relatively shallow, and most that decay ends up back in the atmosphere, unless locked in some kind of peat bog or permafrost. Tightly bound soil carbon in a mollic epipedon is considered differently than the labile carbon pool. It is the stable fraction of soil carbon, and grassland biomes pump 30% or more of their total products of photosynthesis into this liquid carbon pathway.The importance of this recent discovery of the Liquid Carbon Pathway (photosynthesis-root exudates-mycorrhizal fungi-glomalin-humic polymers-mollic epipedon) to climate science AND agriculture can not be stressed enough.[Mollic Epipedon][1][Glomalin: A soil protein important in soil sequestration][2][Glomalin Is Key To Locking Up Soil Carbon][3][Liquid carbon pathway unrecognised][4][Cenozoic Expansion of Grasslands and Climatic Cooling][5]So while specifically Dyson was wrong, he has identified in the most general terms the pathway forward. ‰ÛÏPlants‰Ûù is too general. Forests is categorically wrong, although we still need them for their rapid buffering capability on climate as well as many other important ecosystem services, not to mention lumber. But the forcing of CO2 mitigation long term comes from the grassland biome, now largely under agricultural management and that is plants after all. Dyson got the wrong plants and the wrong soils, but did hit on the right concept.The real question is can this mitigation strategy work within conservative ideals so that a political coalition between both liberals and conservatives can be made to devise a plan acceptable to both? It is pretty obvious that a carbon tax has and will continue to meet with opposition.I believe it is possible, yes. But certain areas will take dramatic change for that to happen. Most importantly energy and agriculture. Right now both those sectors have already overgrown what can be sustained. Quite predictable since they were never really sustainable since the industrial revolution anyway. Just took a while for people to realise it.For it to happen though, agriculture production models will need to be changed to regenerative systems, energy will need technological fixes like solar and nuclear etc. and overall since population has already exceeded environmental capacity, a large amount of ecosystem recovery projects will be needed as well. So yeah, reforesting can be a part where appropriate. All of these are possible, however I personally believe they are unlikely to happen on their own given social and institutional inertia.My focus is on agriculture. Having studied it quite intensely for years, I believe we currently have the ability to fix that one. Only a few minor gaps remain. I can only hope others committed to the other two big ones meet with similar success. But then comes the hard part, actually doing what we know how to do before these unsustainable systems currently in effect start failing world wide, collapsing even our ability to do what we know how to do! That‰Ûªs the actual tricky part.For example, if agriculture fails before we fully institute regenerative models and the infrastructure changes needed, civilization collapses. Not much going to be done about it then. AGW will see to it that all three will fail if changes are not done soon enough. Once again with the potential to collapse civilization, or at least many nations including ours. Again making it near impossible to implement what we already know how to do.So how do we institute the changes needed in a free market economic base beneficial to mitigating AGW?The most important leg is agriculture. The answer may be more simple than you think. The rise of ‰ÛÏking corn‰Ûù can be seen as a direct result of a series of changes in agricultural policy instituted by Earl Lauer Butz, Secretary of Agriculture under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Most important to this policy change was the Buffer stock scheme (ever full granary) combined with urgings to farmers to ‰ÛÏget big or get out‰Ûù. (Which happened by the way. Now there is actually a crisis from too few family farmers, average age being 60.) That led to huge surpluses which we then were able to successfully use for many purposes, including major grain sales to Russia and China and many humanitarian aid projects.Something has changed though. Now China has opened up beef sales. This is a value added commodity over grain. It makes more sense to drop the buffer stock scheme on grain, and instead I propose a buffer stock scheme on grass fed beef instead. You can do this on the same amount of subsidies that we currently use for grain, and instead put them on restoring the great prairies/steppes/savannas of the world‰Û_.raising beef. This would positively affect carbon sequestration, pesticide use, erosion, seasonal dead zones in our productive coastal waters, biodiversity, energy budget, economic growth, international trade balance, rural economic development, etc‰Û_ AND if done properly, as many case studies at the USDA-SARE & USDA-NRCS clearly show, even increase total yields of food for humans.So to fully answer, instead of adding a carbon tax, one way to solve this is simply change what we subsidize. No need for new taxes. In agriculture instead of a buffer stock scheme on king corn, a buffer stock scheme on carbon being sequestered in soils. Just redirect the same amount of funds away from one to the other. Same goes for energy. Fossil-fuel consumption subsidies worldwide amounted to $493 billion in 2014, with subsidies to oil products representing over half of the total. Those subsidies were over four-times the value of subsidies to renewable energy. Simply redirect the subsidies for fossil fuels over to renewables. Doesn‰Ûªt necessarily need to cost one penny more.The idea that we are still subsidizing AGW, while trying to find solutions to AGW is quite frankly ridiculous. Goes to the wise old saying, ‰ÛÏA house divided against itself can not stand.‰ÛùNow for some interesting general numbers. ‰ÛÏUnder appropriate conditions, 30-40% of the carbon fixed in green leaves can be transferred to soil andrapidly humified, resulting in rates of soil carbon sequestration in the order of 5-20 tonnes of CO2 perhectare per year.‰Ûù[Liquid carbon pathway unrecognised][6][Fast facts: The State of the World‰Ûªs Land and Water Resources][7]5-20 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year x 1.5 billion hectares  = 7.5 - 30.0 billion tonnes of CO2 per year AND that's just arable cropland, that doesn't even include the ecosystem recovery projects that could be done on degraded desertified rangeland mentioned by Allan Savory in his famous TedTalk. That's actually a larger area of land, but much more complicated to calculate. Because some rangeland is healthy and currently sequestering carbon in the LCP. A larger % is degraded by overgrazing and/or undergrazing, both causes of desertification and either nearly net zero flux, or actually a CO2 emissions source. Depending on the brittleness factor, they also each respond differently when properly managed. So it is difficult to quantify exactly how much more CO2 could be sequestered per year restoring these areas, but likely even more total (but less per hectare). China's restoration project of the desertified Loess Plateau early results shows just how significant this can be.[Allan Savory: How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change][8][Soil carbon sequestration potential for ""Grain for Green"" project in Loess Plateau, China][9]Little to no cost.

Freon-type compounds are strong absorbers of infrared radiation, much stronger than CO2. EPA produced reports on both ozone and the greenhouse effect about the same time. The main reasons for studying each are different. CO2 absorbs enough heat to be a long-term temperature regulator for the planet. That fact means CO2 gets the most study. Freon-type refrigerants replaced low temperature boiling compounds like ammonia and sulfur dioxide, which are toxic when they leak. Freon compounds are very stable chemically and safe. Biological processes cannot break them down. Therefore, after only a few decades of use they became very common in the atmosphere. The only place they can be broken down is in the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.Ozone contains three atoms of oxygen instead of two, and is a strong oxidizer. It is formed as sunlight breaks down O2 and creates free radicals. A thin layer of our upper atmosphere contains about 10 ppm ozone, and this layer absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Scientists discovered that ozone worked on the Freon compounds mostly in the polar areas, and mostly around the south pole. Freon was breaking down our ozone protective shield, causing increased skin cancers in Australia, South Africa, and southern South America. It was expected to soon be killing algae in the Antarctic seas that formed the base of the food chain.Unlike the climate deniers that still block progress on reducing fossil fuel use, the chemical industry immediately went to work developing Freon substitutes that would be easily broken down. The patents were shared and governments worked together to require use of the new compounds. The higher molecular weight of the new compounds required higher pressure compressors that more agreements soon phased in. A conference in Canada a few years ago resulted in amendments due to increased use of refrigerants around the world."

I consider it both the most dangerous and the most likely of all the tipping elements on that list.I am though a bit fuzzy on what you mean by ""policy relevant"". I understand it refers somewhat to if people care enough to use it as a case for changing public policies towards climate change, and within a time frame that means it effects us and our children, and not just some far distant potential effect that might  happen thousands of years from now; but it is still pretty confusing. If you could explain that better it would be helpful.The main tipping element that is missing on that list is soil degradation though. Far more dangerous, far more likely, and with far greater impact that all the others combined by orders of magnitude. In about ~50 years or so agriculture will use up the remaining latent soil fertility of the world's arable land and no longer be capable of feeding the population. When that tipping point happens there will be a land grab that destroys the ecosystem function on the last few remaining wilderness areas. This will happen regardless of protests, because above all people need to eat. That will however doom us due to total biosphere collapse. The biological stabilising feedbacks present in the current climate systems will collapse with them, and runaway global warming will likely result very rapidly. It's the worst case scenario for AGW....an extinction level event.Is it policy relevant? I suppose so, since it is current policies that are accelerating it, and a change in policy could completely eliminate it... Likelihood it will happen? Without radical changes in agriculture...100%, with changes???? I personally believe we can and will change policy before it happens, and those changes can be implemented fast enough. I am in the minority here though. Most don't believe the changes will be successful, or they believe they can't be implemented fast enough, or they are trying to develop new technologies to avoid the collapse, like GMO's and various hydroponics etc.... Foolish in my personal opinion, because we have already the tools needed, developing new ones that may or may not work seems fruitless. But yeah, your paper missed the biggest tipping element of all.[Farming Claims Almost Half Earth's Land, New Maps Show][1][Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues][2]  [1]: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1209_051209_crops_map.html  [2]: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/"

It is slightly different from the uncertainty about climate sensitivity, because an uncertainty in an age is just an uncertainty in a finite number. But uncertainty within the climate sensitivity index is more like piling uncertainty on top of uncertainty. When you study science, you become used to uncertainty, though. We can never prove anything --we can only say that our evidence supports the theory. And over time, uncertainty about some things decreases as our models or techniques improve. That's what we're all working toward. So I'd say I'm comfortable with uncertainty. I'm comfortable understanding that decisions we make can't be based on 100% certainty of something particular happening.

Have a look at slide 14 of the slides for section 2.4 (here's a [link to the PDF,][1] or you can get it from the right-hand side of the home page, or within section 2.4). That slide describes the feedback you allude to between temperature and CO2 on glacial-interglacial time scales.  CO2 can be part of a feedback, as you point out.  And you're right that it is a component of a feedback on glacial-interglacial time scales.  But that does not negate the fact that CO2 from human emissions today and in the past is a *forcing* in the climate system.  As we add CO2 to the atmosphere, we're changing the greenhouse effect.  We're not responding to temperature changes when we choose to emit CO2, and the CO2 going into the atmosphere has a clear human fingerprint. The temperature changes that could be induced directly by changes to the incoming W/m2 resulting from orbital cycles are not large enough to have produced the 5-6 degC global average temperature shifts observed between ice ages and interglacial periods.  Feedbacks operating here on Earth, most likely the ice-albedo feedback and feedbacks involving CO2 (e.g the one described on slide 14 of 2.4) had to have amplified the ""push"" from the orbital changes.  Certainly today there are also feedbacks involving CO2, e.g. warming --> thawing permafrost -->CO2 emissions from permafrost --> more warming, but human-sourced CO2 is clearly a forcing.  Thanks for bringing up this important issue.   [1]: https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:UBCx+Climate101x+3T2015+type@asset+block/2.4OurGeologicBackdrop.pdf"

If energy in is larger than energy out, heat will accumulate here on earth. However the question then becomes, where does this extra heat go. There are essentially 4 reservoirs where heat can be added. The atmosphere, oceans, land and cryosphere (the domain of Ice). The oceans can warm, the air can warm, the land surface can warm, and the ice can melt. But these different reservoirs require vastly different amounts of energy to raise there temperature by the same amount.Heating a litre of water by 1 degree takes around 1000 times as much energy as heating a litre of air by one degree. And because the oceans can mix heat around, and sunlight can penetrate 10's of meters into the ocean, the oceans absorb the bulk of the extra energy. The figures are that the oceans are absorbing around 93% of the extra energy while the remaining extra energy is divided up roughly equally between the land, ice and air. So what we see as the headline temperature changes, and the ones that impact on us the most, air temperature changes, represent less than 2% of the extra energy accumulating.Also, the climate/weather system involves significant year on year fluctuations in the internal energy transfers **between** the different parts of the system, particularly energy exchanges between the air and oceans. The current El Nino is an example of this. Given the large thermal mass of the oceans and the low thermal mass of the air, the temperature signal in the atmosphere is very 'noisy', where long term trends can be masked by short term fluctuation. Thus the usual standard used to consider changes in the atmosphere is an average over 30 years. It takes around that long to discern clear trends in the atmosphere. In contrast, with its much greater thermal mass, the oceans can show clearer trends in shorter timescales. Here is the measurements of energy buildup in the top 2000 meters of the oceans. That is around 1/2 the volume of the oceans. You can see it here - select panel 2 in the animation. http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/![NOAA OHC to 2000M][1]Although there is still annual variation, there is a much clearer upwards trend and no hiatus in warming. This is what 93% of the heat accumulation is doing.Applying a mark 1 eyeball, I come up with a rate of warming in recent years of over 350 trillion watts. Since the Earth has a surface area of around 500 trillion m^2, that is a rate of over 0.7 watts/m^2. Not far off the imbalance from the chart in module 3.2. And importantly, that rate of warming can't be coming from any terrestrial source. Total human energy emissions are around 18 trillion watts, and total geothermal emissions are between 44 and 47 trillion watts. So that number must represent an external energy imbalance.While we are concerned with what happens to air temperatures, that is where we live, in energy balance terms, the main game is in the oceans. The air is just the tail that gets wagged by the dog that is the oceans.And as you can see from the graph, warming hasn't stopped or slowed, it is actually increasing. There is no significant variability beyond the annual, seasonal cycle. And the measured change is within the scale of heat accumulation expected based on the TOA energy balance estimates. The oceans are the primary indicator of whether the earth is warming. And at an even simpler level, sea level rise is the most basic indicator. Global sea level rises because ice on land is melting, adding water to the oceans, requiring extra heat, or because the oceans are warming and expanding. Like the mercury in a thermometer rises when it warms. The oceans are the worlds thermometer. If they are rising, the earth is warming.  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14638107125300425.png"

Although recent developments made in the political and cultural atmosphere has created a better and brighter image for this state of India. Goa is situated on the West coast of India bound by Maharashtra in the North and Karnataka in the South and the Arabian Sea which forms the coast.  Its climate is characterized by hot and humid throughout the year with tropical monsoon climates and short winter months (December-February).As stated earlier, the state is a tourist hub due to its rich biodiversity, heritage and most of all, its serene and beautiful beaches. But this story is taking a minor U-turn due to the global climate change which has caused consequences for many years. This change has already caused abnormal weather conditions like daily high maximum and minimum temperatures, hazy days and frequent unseasonal rains in June and July. Climate change as we all know is variation in climate causing disruptions in seasonal periods, changing sea levels and a lot more. The rising sea level has been a major concern for Goa, owing to its position on the globe and shorter coastline. Most of the coastal areas of Goa are suffering losses in beach area and destruction of coastal mangroves and saltpans. According to environmentalists, Goa will see processes of desertification and temperature changes with unequal distribution of rainfall.According to data presented in a legislative assembly session a few years ago, more than 10% of the beaches like Candolim, Baga and Calangute have been eroded due to global warming and subsequent sea level rise. An article on the book, ‰ÛÏGlobal Warming and Climate Change‰Ûù has made several claims which serve as eye openers for the environmentalists and the general public. About 4.3 percent of Goa‰Ûªs coastline has been affected by rising of sea level. Also another claim stated that by 2050, a level rise of about 50-60 meters can be catastrophic causing huge losses of land and flora.This erosion of beaches could be harmful to the economy of the State as it heavily relies on tourism. Reduction in beach area and unequal distribution of rainfall causing droughts or destruction of the floral community are some of the possible consequences to occur. Houses and building projects are located near the beaches and also in different parts in the interior. So what happens to those homes built right next to the beaches or the shorelines? And the impact to the homes built on hillsides to facilitate serene views of the city and beaches?Another consequence to an already existing consequence. People will migrate inwards to the city or shift to a new location probably out of Goa. Agricultural lands have to be cleared to pave way for new projects leaving the farmers with limited options adding more pressure in terms of their financial and social needs. And the list goes on.Climate change and its consequences have continued to intensify over the years and this situation is left for us citizens of the world to tackle it in the most efficient way we can. We should raise our voices and not the sea levels. ReferencesClimate Change will affect Goa beaches: Study (2009, November 9).

Carbon compounds are what holds the soil structure and restores degraded soil to fertility. There isn't even enough CO2 in the atmosphere to really restore our soils worldwide as it stands now.

When a tree is taken down for the purpose of building a house, and that house is well maintained and stands for 200 years, is that ""better"" carbon sequestration than not using trees for construction?  Wouldn't it be better to just let trees stand?Here are a couple of my thoughts about this, but I don't think it is easily answered. What are the alternatives and how do they compare?  If cement is used instead of wood, we know that releases a lot of carbon from long term storage.  Wood construction seems clearly better than cement construction.  It is more difficult to determine if stone is used, and cement is just a binder.  If steel is the primary structural component, I do not know for sure how it compares in carbon cost, but strongly suspect, the construction carbon cost is higher, and there is much less carbon sequestration.  These, I think indicate wood construction is at least better than alternatives.  How long can wood construction really last?  In the US and Canada, we don't have many ""really old"" buildings.  A small number that are 200+ years.  The oldest homes seem to be primarily of stone construction as seems to be the case of many old buildings in Europe.  I'm sure there are rare exceptionally cared for wood buildings in the world, but I think it's safe to argue that wood construction on average lasts decades - maybe a hundred years.  That's similar to the lifetime of most trees.  But I think it is arguable, that well managed forestry, that takes less than 100 year growth and turns that product into a structure that stands several more decades to a hundred years is helping to sequester carbon when compared to letting the tree die and decay naturally.  A key part of that though is well managed lumber forest -- clear cutting seems to me to disturb too much biomass.  The trees need to be replaced as fast as they are taken, and since it takes from decades to 100+ years to grow lumber for structures, lumber companies must use patience -- keeping their stock the same -- not diminishing it.  On top of that, I suspect most wood structures when torn down are mostly sent to land fills rather than left to rot, so that wood *might* sequester the carbon much longer.  Data on that is likely hard to produce one way or another.  I think that's part of the reason bamboo has become very popular. It grows and is ready for harvest in just a couple of years.  It is relatively easily replaced.  If a bamboo is turned into wood, then continues to sequester carbon for decades in some form of structure, that's a lot of carbon sequestration for a relatively short growth investment. It still has to be well managed and the harvesting cannot destroy habitat in the process. So, I don't think the BC government is being disingenuous by the assertion that harvesting trees is a good method of long term carbon storage.  The key is not ""cutting down trees"" is a good plan, but that maintaining managed wood production where the stock remains constant despite production of products is a good plan."

So slash and burn clear cuts are out, but proper long term management is fine. Not really helping mitigate AGW, but not really causing it either. Compared to other things that are decidedly causing AGW, it is better than most. As a strategy to mitigate AGW though? Insignificant.On the other hand if one were to combine this nearly carbon neutral practise with silvopasture (combining forestry and grazing of domesticated animals in a mutually beneficial way), where the trees hold most the biomass, but the area between the ""open forest"" is maintained as a rough grassland. Those grasses would sequester large quantities of carbon in the soil as part of a mollic epipedon. In that case you would have the best of all worlds, a sustainable biome capable of sustaining wildlife, mitigating AGW, and providing food and fiber for people, all at the same time."

I realize that Lenton, et al say that the greatest and clearest threat is to the summer ice in the Arctic, but I assume they mean ""threat"" with respect to tipping the climate into runaway warming, not threat with respect to humanity directly. Although I suppose if the question for policy-makers is ""can the occurrence of this tipping point be tolerated""? the answer would be that any tipping point that leads to runaway warning in the end would also pose the greatest threat to humanity. It's also hard for me to get my head around the relation of tipping points to policy because I can't really understand how any government has any policy other than ""do everything we can to keep the rest of it in the ground and get as much as we can of it out of the air -- ASAP."" Especially because it seems that recent evidence suggests that regional tipping points may appear even with warming under 2 degrees (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151015084348.htm). This is a side note, but I was intrigued by the study Lenton, et al cite at the end of their paper -- that one that suggests there might be potential tipping elements in human socioeconomic systems, since some models indicate that there might be a tipping point for the transition to a low-carbon-energy system. I wonder how those models work and what they actually show. Is it that once enough low-carbon energy is produced it's cheaper to continue to produce low-carbon energy? That modeling might give a boost to what in the US is called political ""incrementalism."""
