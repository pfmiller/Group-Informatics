<p>Prior to the workshop, I ask you to read (or at least scan) four (ok, 7) papers of mine which will give you a conceptual overview of how I, as a researcher, apply social network analysis in learning (and other) contexts.  They are listed below:</p>

<p>You should load, if you can, “R” (r-project.org) and Gephi on your computers <a href="https://gephi.org">https://gephi.org</a> . Also, loading the github client may be helpful for you.  But not necessary. </p>

<p>I think you may find it surprising how such a prominent technique for understanding social structure evolved from a number of distinct disciplines. Most recently, SNA as a method has taken what I think of as a signifiant mathematical turn (I make no value judgments about this ... ok, I kind of do).  Using Social Network Analysis to identify structure in technology mediated learning environments could be as "easy" as treating each user act as an edge, and each user as a node. (Node == "Thing/Person"; Edge == "Connection between two things or people.) In the first four readings (or "airplane scanning tasks) I sent you in advance of our workshop, you note that I am making an argument for a systematic approach to using SNA in learning analytics. An approach that is both empirically and theoretically informed, and guides the researcher to make explicit decisions about how nodes are defined and how the strength of connection between those nodes (edges or "lines") are presented. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sociallycompute.io/Freeman%202004.pdf">This book by Linton Freeman provides an excellent history of the multidisciplinary evolution of Social Network Analysis:</a></p>

<p>Social Network Analysis is widely used, and sometimes not used well to understand technology mediated learning and a host of other phenomena that emerge online. <a href="http://www.sociallycompute.io/HWC.pdf">Howison, Wiggins and Crowston</a> point out a number of significant flaws in prior applications of SNA methods, developed for the study of human's and the social structures they create in the physical world, to "electronic trace data" (log files) generated through online behavior. The Freeman history, the Howison, Wiggins and Crowston critique and the four papers I provided help frame the challenges of using SNA well as a method for making sense of learning and developing learning analytics. </p>

<p><strong>There will be code, but you do not need to be an experienced developer to gain knowledge from this workshop.</strong> Everything we do will connect concepts to worked examples. The concepts will fuel research questions, and the worked examples will provide a foundation for setting about to answer them. </p>
